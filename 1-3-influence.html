<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Influence</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Parsons (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Parsons1963Concept" role="doc-biblioref">1963</a>)</span> used the term influence to describe generalized knowledge-based authority. Influence is a symbolic medium of communication like money, which represents a value without being the value. Symbols are more easily transacted than the real resources they represent, and they allow trades to be constructed as social commitments before real resources are mobilized. The password list is a symbol of a supplicant’s capacity to uphold genre conventions and safeguard the status of a field, a promise which they aim to transact for access to real resources, namely employment, in a scholarly profession. Like money, influence is subject to inflation (requiring a candidate to know even more than the password list) and deflation (being unimpressed no matter how much a candidate knows). Importantly influence is not reputation; it is a feature of the status of the field rather than the status of an individual. All knowledge holders transacting with a club will be similarly affected by inflation or deflation of the field’s influence.</p>
<div id="forgetting" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.0.1</span> Forgetting</h4>
<p>Library technology, paradoxically, makes it easy to forget scholarship. <span class="citation">(Cevolini <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Cevolini2016Forgetting" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> A scholar who is confident that knowledge is safely protected in archives and who believes that it can always be accurately retrieved is relieved of the urgency of digesting it now.
Punting on understanding <em>from</em> texts opens space for exogenous understandings <em>of</em> texts. Contemporaneous cultures and societies constraining the reader prejudge the meanings of texts. While scholars genuflect to a quest for truth, the practical incentive to minimize time spent reading leads to several methods of collusion in the reduction of texts.</p>
<p>First, any text that can be commonly declared irrelevant need not be bothered with it all. Forgetting is the most efficient way to deal with a text.</p>
<p>Second, a text need not be read to be understood, as their meanings are common sense. Texts then have reputations and reputed meanings. These reputations like those of people stand in for the real thing in scholarly discourse. These mediated versions of the truth act as promissory notes in scholarly transactions; where the reputed meaning is accurately conveyed the issuing party is given credit for knowing the underlying truth, without burdening the transaction with a test of the truth. Like all symbolic currencies, the pace of commerce quickens where the symbol of the good is exchanged prior to the good itself needing to be mobilized.</p>
<p>The utility of reputed rather than real meanings functions to save scholars from the existential crisis besieging them: the pace of the publication of scholarship has long outpaced anyone’s capacity to read it. The existence of subdisciplines is an obvious symptom of this trend bemoaned by every generation of scholars.</p>

<div id="collins" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.0.2</span> Collins</h4>
<p>Genre is a form of meta-expertise called <em>ubiquitous discrimination</em> <span class="citation">(Collins and Evans <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Collins2007Rethinking" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>:45)</span>, which reflects a layperson’s ability to make judgments (genre classifications) about what might otherwise be considered esoteric content. Ubiquitous knowledge is assumed to be available to all members of a society, even if not everyone necessarily acquires it. This absolute criterion is not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Bodies of knowledge and practice, cultures, exist because of yet apart from particular people. While some cultures are ubiquitous and inculcated in all members of the societies in which they are substantiated, others are esoteric and marked by significant barriers to learning them. Such esoteric cultures are as inaccessible as they are unnecessary. A child who does not learn what to eat and how to eat it in her local culture will have great difficulty doing anything else in her society. Food culture is of the ubiquitous type and is not difficult to learn. On the other hand, a child who does not master scripture will be ashamed at temple, but shame is bearable in a way that hunger is not. Scripture is of the esoteric type; knowledge of it enables special abilities and grants access to restricted aspects of a society, but ignorance of it does not threaten one’s lay livelihood. Even in religiously totalitarian societies, what religious knowledge is necessary will be ubiquitous. What religious knowledge is esoteric can be safely left to the clergy. It is not too narrowly circular to say that the knowledge that informs daily life is the easiest to acquire, and that the mere act of living also reproduces that knowledge within contexts that are themselves ubiquitous. Whether relationships of ubiquity are familial, economic, or state relations varies by society, but no society lacks ubiquitous culture and the means of reproducing it.</p>
<p>Esoteric cultures, then, are removed from ubiquitous ones though they depend on them. They require specialized social relationships for their reproduction in populations. These special relationships may be called fields of cultural production (FCP). FCPs are both reproductive of extant knowledge and productive of novel knowledge relevant usually only to the field itself. To the extent that esoteric cultures are complicated or otherwise have high entropy, the failure to reproduce their cultural content is always an existential threat. While it is a guarantee that cultural content is constantly actually lost to reproduction failures, cultures that nonetheless persist historically must always have a socially structured FCP that, in inculcating new members and reinforcing the knowledge of extant members, resists the entropic decay that would otherwise lead to extinction.</p>
<p>The scope of a culture has a knowledge and a social dimension. Units of knowledge are both discrete and combinatoric. Discretely, the size of a culture can be measured by a count of co-occurring ideas and skills. The utility of knowledge, for instance as instantiated in an FCP, often depends on the combination and interaction of such discrete elements. The mass of knowledge in a culture is related to the count of units and to the ease with which those units can be learned, thought, or deployed in meaningful activity. Some cultures are easier than others, and it is the effort-adjusted size that is the real mass of the ideational content of a culture.</p>
<p>Not all sociologically relevant information is cultural. In the triadic relationship among culture, social structure, and personality, psychological concepts like schema that are sometimes treated as constitutive of social structure <span class="citation">(Sewell <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Sewell1992Theory" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> do not belong in the category of culture. Schemas allow personalities to organize their responses to a world that includes many things beside culture. In order for cultures and social structures to function stably in time, they depend on the successful operation of schemas, but they do not necessarily provision them. An only partial exception is the limiting and very specialized cases of pedagogical institutions. A culture can only exist if people can reproduce it, but the people must solve the psychological problems of cognition on their own. Whereas culture is fungible in its different mediated forms, there is no reason to believe that a “single schema” occurs across a population of people. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions to human motivation, and schemas will to a large extent be idiosyncratic, adapted as they must be to the particular circumstances in which people as träger find themselves.</p>
<p>What cultures can do to hedge their bets against the instability of personalities is to introduce kinds of knowledge adapted to cognitive problems. Schutz identifies systems of relevance from the side of personalities, and here we understand the same from the side of cultures.</p>
<p>People know culture and it does not appear apart from them. Put differently, culture is information and people are the media that concretely manifest it. The size of a culture is the count of the unique ideas and idea combinations appearing in a deduplicated media catalog, excluding possible but unrealized combinations. The potential of a culture is the size of the realized and unrealized combinations, where the number of elements in a set is limited by a given historical cognitive and technological memory capacity. The potential of a real culture is always greater than its size, as combination novelty always easily exceeds the available media.</p>
<p>The social mass of the culture is the enumeration of the media in which cultural content actually appears historically. The cultural mass is copied piecemeal among a population of knowers. The mass may be enlarged by information technology by making it easier to access and transmit culture, but the artifacts and technology themselves do not count in the mass of the culture. Real, historical human nervous systems, including language expression,</p>
<p>Dead cultures cannot live again because the dead part, the social part, is highly ephemeral. Even if a culture leaves material and symbolic artifacts, the “dead” parts are precisely those human relationships that would socialize new members in particular ways that cannot be deduced by people who never belonged to begin with, namely the archaeologists of the future. Such archaeologists belong to the FCP of their own time, and approach the historical artifacts of a dead culture as any other FCP approaches regular patterns in the world, as subject to their own particular cultural logics.</p>
<p>Reproduction does not necessarily imply long term consistency of cultural content, indeed a high level of knowledge loss may be a sign of historical stability in an esoteric culture if it results from a highly productive FCP. An oversupply of cultural content increases the chances that some, any culture can be conveyed into the future in a chain of descent.</p>
<p>Esoteric knowledge is essentially cryptic, ubiquitous knowledge essentially evident. Crypticism means that laity cannot acquire knowledge on their own, that is, without socially structured access to an FCP. Esotericism is the social consequence of crypticism. Cultures vary by knowledge features, as knowledge is a social axis of power along which status hierarchy necessarily develops. Knowledge asymmetry structures social relationships, usually leading to status inequality.</p>
<p>High entropy cultures must socialize new and maintain existing members like any culture, but their complications also tend to be generative of novelty.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous cultures will be learned because there is nothing in a society to do without knowing them, while esoteric ones are guaranteed to be forgotten by most, swapped easily for the always ready ubiquitous alternatives. Ubiquitous cultures have high ambient findability <span class="citation">(Morville <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Morville2009Ambient" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, they can be transparently acquired for instance through mimicry <span class="citation">(DiMaggio and Powell <a href="bibliography.html#ref-DiMaggio1983Iron" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>FCPs are social structures that can be thought of as the articulation points between people and a special type of culture that is associated with higher education.</p>
<p>To be sure, if esoteric cultures are marked by asymmetries of knowledge between laity and clergy, to continue with the religious example, one must admit that such asymmetries exist in ubiquitous culture as well, as in the supposed ignorance of a child against the learning of an adult. The ignorance of children combined with their megalomania is a useful example of how social structures operate. Social structures are always culturally conservative; a child’s ignorance is a generative force, as they may attempt to solve problems in novel ways, and their efforts will frequently be corrected by the experts. Whether the correction takes marks the chagrin of the parent. Children quickly become specialists in their own FCPs, but this is never because they aren’t also aware of the ubiquity. They may know it, it may bore them, and they efface it for fun. But they know what is ubiquitous; their proximity to ignorance of it may animate their creative abrogation of culture. The essentially conservative function of pedagogy will stamp out that creative flame in time. Indeed children are a great source of entropy for ubiquitous culture, hence the large investment in education generally.</p>
<p>This evolutionary argument can be more simply stated as, complicated cultures cannot exist for very long without stewardship.</p>
