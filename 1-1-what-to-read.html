<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What to read?</h2>
<p>The question of what to read is simple to be sure, but in fields of scholarly consumption and production it is nonetheless fundamental. Scholarship is a creative profession where a stock of cultural knowledge forms a greater part of the infrastructure of production than in other fields. This is not to say that other occupations, especially manual ones, lack creativity. It is to say that in such fields knowledge has a limited infrastructure. Whereas the know-how of the brick layer is black boxed in her tools and technology and in the human capital she develops by experience and tacit social learning, for the scholar as bricoleur there exists in addition the distinctively overdeveloped feature of cultural archiving as a universal memory. Except perhaps in outstanding feats of primary research, contributions to scholarship are legitimate to the extent that they have used the archive correctly.</p>
<p>This problem of using the archive, by which we mean all libraries and other organizations that help scholars find published work, is easily expressed by the question, “what to read?” Paradoxically, the over-development of the archive promotes a functional imperative: to the extent that more and more of scholarship is memorable, mechanisms must develop to forget large swaths of intellectual history. A person who studied a random draw from the archive, even a monumental one, would no doubt qualify as an educated person. Professionally, however, they would have answered the question in a tragically wrong way. From the perspective of other scholars, there are right and wrong choices about what to read. Because it is so easy to access scholarly memory, the operative question really becomes “what not to read?”</p>
<p>Though Internet search and self-publishing services, especially video and image based ones, are creating archive-like infrastructure for all occupations, even manual ones, the functions are different. Contemporary Internet repositories provide knowledge as factors of production to anyone who queries them, but many do not purport to be archives in the sense that a historical record of cultural products is preserved for posterity. They are much more concerned with access to contemporaneous than to historical material, and indeed the particular configuration of the contemporary that sells the most ads ahead of search results. True historical archives of the Internet, such as the Internet Archive or Common Crawl, are not used by the public. Indeed why would they be; they expose the dizzying complexity of the history of the Internet, which, even in only its contemporaneous facet is already overwhelming. The Internet searcher tends to be satisficing, and the search companies have refined their ranking of results to meet their users’ search budgets efficiently.</p>
<p>Thus Internet search services perform the function of complexity reduction in their own arbitrary way. They do this without the scholarly paradox of memory, which is that in the university system great pains are made to remember everything just so that the correct material may be forgotten. In the cynical view of professions, scholarship is the encryption of memory by secret sets. A lay seeker approaches the academic archive and at great cost of attention plumbs its depths for enlightenment. Tragically, the archive’s complexity dooms her to check out a curriculum so hopelessly tacky that it will only certify her lay status. To be professional is to trade in status, to know what are the tasteful combinations of resources. To be a successful professional is to never have wasted time tasting forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>Yet the truly tragic figures are the archivists themselves who are stretched between the opposing poles of profession and education. Librarians much prefer to help undergraduates who lack taste and therefore welcome guides who will lead them through the grandeur of the archive. They gifted scholars with access to an immortal memory, and looking the horse in the mouth scholars made rules to protect themselves from the responsibilities of using most of it. Paradoxically, in taking the burden of memory off of the shoulders of scholars, thereby freeing them of the pain of legacy suffered by other artists <span class="citation">(Lang and Lang <a href="#ref-Lang1988Recognition" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>)</span>, librarians created a maze of knowledge in which clergy could trap laity. In this way a taste for scholarship is the axis sorting the field between people who profess (declare publicly) and people who educate (lead out).</p>
<p>So again, how do professional scholars know what (not) to read? What then are the structures that lead scholars new and old to answer the question correctly? How does one know what are the lucrative curricula that can be developed from the archive? There are several formal and informal structures that facilitate and compel scholars to make the same choices about what to read. An obvious one is the supposed normative isomorphism of graduate program syllabi, which act like maps to navigate the maze of the archive. Yet it is a common concern that the quality of syllabi are variable. Universities tend to grant great autonomy to professors in writing syllabi, who in the course of their professional travails may not be given opportunities to read what they want. In being forced to carve out time with subordinates, faculty are caught between personal indulgence and a more or less strongly felt fiduciary responsibility to set students on the correct path. If we have less than perfect faith in the strength of educational ethics among faculty, then we should expect that among graduate syllabi are many lists of what not to read. Students who trust too much in the formal curriculum may be lead astray, and even without trust, they may still be left ignorant of where to invest their labor.</p>
<p>In each program there then must be a hidden curriculum, a map of higher quality. The argument of this study addresses the question of where such a curriculum could possibly come from. The provisional answer is that in the informal spaces of graduate programs knowledge of <em>scholarly genre</em> is learned from extracurricular engagement with professional conferences. It is in conference programs that the tacit rules of academic genre are learnable. These genres form the first parsing of the archive for neophytes. Indeed at the most generic level graduate students, if they are confident enough to locate themselves quickly enough, develop a taste for what not to read. Genre as the foundation for a taste for scholarship serves to restrict a student’s wandering to a delineable sector of the maze. If they can develop this proto-taste early enough in their careers, they will be armed with the stereotypes necessary to stop reading the wrong and start reading the right material. While this is not enough certainly to make clergy of laity, it is the first step.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Genres</h3>
<p>I take genre as a candidate explicans for the ability of scholars to know what to read and what to avoid from the cultural archive. A theory of genre will benefit from a review of the literature, yet to do so would catch me in the conundrum of performing the phenomenon I wish to explain. The genre structure of sociology should guide me to a definition of genre, a statement that already presumes an ontological difference and morphological relation between disciplines and genres, namely that scholarly genres are not equivalent to scholarly disciplines and that the former are located within the later. I will begin with an unstudied attempt to tease out the relation of discipline and genre before turning to a more rigorous, even empirical, treatment of genre as a term in American scholarship.</p>
<p>Genre is a loanword from French. The origin of the French-Latin word “genre” and the English-German word “kind” both mean membership by inheritance of innate class characteristics, archaically by presumptive blood descent within a family, race, or nation. In common English it is restricted to mean a broad category of art, especially literature and music, and some but not all other cultural fields (e.g. baseball is not a genre of sports). As a term in scholarship, genre may be an observable phenomenon, a conceptual component of a theory, or a conflation of the two. In the social sciences genre is a specialty concept as in sociology, while in the humanities it is ubiquitous especially in cultural studies. Academics define and use the term differently between and within disciplines.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="1-1-what-to-read.html#fig:ttsgnr">1.1</a> shows the count of mentions of the term genre in the Google Books Ngram database for English terms <span class="citation">(Michel et al. <a href="#ref-Michel2011Quantitative" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. The trend exhibits the typical take-off in publishing in the second half of the twentieth century. I apply change point analysis, which detects significant differences in time series data <span class="citation">(James and Matteson <a href="#ref-James2019ecp" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Matteson and James <a href="#ref-Matteson2013Nonparametric" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, to the second difference of the trend, a measure of acceleration, to get clues as to whether the trend is a single process or whether there are inflection points. The first segment of the curve from 1899 to 1984 indicates a period of positive acceleration or quickening of the growth trend. On average in the first period the rate of change from one year to the next increased by a modest 13.3 occurrences a year. However, during the period from 1985 to 2008 the rate of change, though always steep, began to decline by an average of 238.3 occurrences a year. Like a projectile that is simultaneously climbing and falling, 1984 acts as launch point of precipitous yet unsustainable growth.</p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="1-1-what-to-read.html#fig:ttsgnr2">1.2</a> shows a similar trend but using relative frequencies instead of absolute counts. Here “genre” is plotted as its share of all terms in the corpus. This trend exhibits no inflection point at 1984 that is statistically significant, and visually the trend does appear the same on both sides. No other inflections points are detectable due likely to greater year over year variability in this series in the first half of the century, reducing confidence in any estimate of a change point. To interpret this difference in statistical significance between relative and absolute measures would indicate that interest in genre continued to grow even within a secular slow-down in the volume of texts that resembles the familiar S-shaped diffusion curve. Alternatively, on visual inspection of the relative curve it appears that indeed there is an inflection point, just one a decade later in 1996. After this point the relative frequency seems to drop rapidly, a change that would no doubt be picked up statistically after a few more years of data and one that may in fact be located a few years earlier than the peak suggests. Together these trends describe a career to the term genre that has been strong for a century and that may now be in decline.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="1-1-what-to-read.html#fig:genre-goog">1.3</a> gives an indication of what things the term genre has been used to describe. It illustrates the frequency of terms appearing in the Google Books Ngram corpus as the third term in the trigrams beginning with “genre of” or “genres of” <span class="citation">(Google <a href="#ref-2012Google" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. The size of the words is proportional to the total frequency of the trigram in the English corpus, which spans centuries from 1590 to 2008. The bias of the source–books–is clear in the outsized importance of “literature” and “writing” which are followed closely by “music”. The next ten largest nouns are poetry, discourse, fiction, art, autobiography, painting, film, romance, folklore, and history. Ranked within that series would be several adjectives as well: popular, science (fiction), historical, and literary. Each of these terms refers to a field of concrete cultural products, with the exception of “discourse” which is more abstract.</p>

Figure 1.3: Wordcloud of third term in 3gram beginning with “genre of”.
</p>
</div>
<p>Most items toward the top of the list are less popular (to write about) art forms like television, dance, and theater. Toward the middle of the list begin to appear adaptations of the term from the cultural to the social context. These include practical fields like medicine and journalism, political areas like law, government, and crime, and social arenas like identity and protest.</p>
<p>To impose a sociological gloss on the term, these varied uses of genre would make reviewing the literature on the topic difficult, were it not for the discipline structure of the academy. The uses of the term genre are themselves systematically organized by discipline, and a disciple who is adequately trained will know the correct ways to use the term in her local context. To use genre as a disciplinary convention means to first identify your location in the disciplinary field, and then to accept the limitations on scope by excluding those treatments of the term that are extradisciplinary, that is, irrelevant. Disciplinary structure reduces the true cultural complexity of the meaning of genre to a restricted form, which in turn allows humble knowledge workers to engage upon a set of shared assumptions. Such simplicity begets new complexity as disciples spin out the consequences of their local use of genre.</p>
<p>In the sociology of culture, genre is a form of classification enacted by people in various social contexts. In the context of industrial capitalism, genre is an economic principle helping to organize supply and demand within markets for cultural products. There actors see genres among the borders between economic, social, and cultural uses, as a market category helping them acquire or produce content, as a card in proximate games of prestige, or as something to taste, to consume and enjoy directly. Less often genre is knowledge, a component of culture separate from taste, that is a factor in the formation of ideas and skills, whether these lead in turn to economic production or not.</p>
<p>Genre’s meaning is context specific and variable across sociological subfields, though it is amplified in empiricist fashion by economy and society approaches that reduce genre to the act of classification itself. I say empiricist because of the empirical ease with which the classification or labeling actions are observed. Especially with Internet distribution systems, it becomes trivial for corporations to observe when a consumer labels her preferences while browsing a content catalog; it is much harder to observe the ideas that consuming a particular piece of content sparks in the mind.</p>
<p>In cultural studies genre is used much differently and much more in accordance with its etymology. To the humanist, genre is an ontological phenomenon, which is to say, genres are differentiated from each other by combinations of discrete features of signs and signifieds. Humanists are trained to establish these ontologies through methodological readings of texts and through cultivation of theories of genre types. These methods are at the same time empirical and interpretive, because in consuming objective texts the researcher actually observes the ideas that form in her own consciousness, and they may hope that others have a resonant experience. Genres have more substance to them for humanists than they do for sociologists. For sociologists of culture, genres are how people use genre labels, while for humanists, genres are knowledge.</p>
<p>As we have said, the meaning of genre for a sociologist of culture is economistic, at the same time a market category and a taste configuration for consumers. The term differs for a sociologist of knowledge, and perhaps for a cultural sociologist. It is ontology as it is for the humanist, however it is not the ontology as represented to the researcher in the consumption of texts. It is the hopelessly unobservable distribution of ontologies appearing in a population of consumers attending to similar texts. The sociologist of knowledge accuses the sociologist of culture of reducing internalist concepts, thought and experience, to externalist ones, taste and preference. The sociologist of culture rejoins, show me proof, and on and on the interlocutors spin around the axis defining the boundary between their subfields.</p>
<p>But this description of subdisciplinary differences really is just an example of a structural theory of genre that is within scope for the sociologist of knowledge and beyond it for the sociologist of culture, due to their epistemological differences. If genres are ontological, then they deeply structure a person’s experience of reality. Ontologies form basic perceptual categories, and people with different ontologies of an object experience different things even if oriented to the same objective phenomenon. A ontological theory of genre would, for example, attempt to explain differences in taste as differences in phenomenological perception, whereas a taste theory of genre treats consumption behavior as revealing preferences whose downstream consequences are then explored.</p>
<p>Yet for all the differing treatments of genre mentioned above, do these views really contradict, or are they in fact complementary? Does genre as distribution serve the economic sociologist’s goals, or does a lack of ontological substance lead her astray? Does genre as knowledge remain hopelessly unverifiable, or are theoretical constructs necessary to achieve a correct interpretation of facts? Is everyone at the club listening to the same song hearing the same thing?</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Disciplines</h3>
<p>To return to disciplines, answering such questions would put the researcher in an adisciplinary predicament, for it would mean eschewing the scope restrictions cherished by disciples. The challenges of a meta-disciplinary analysis are manifold and uncertain. One is as likely to grow her audience as to lose it altogether. She risks the dilettantism of a jack-of-all-trades. What’s worse, she exposes herself to a dizzying scale of content to consider. If disciplines are indeed functional, then the meta-analysis that effaces disciplines risks being dysfunctional. The upside, however, is appealing. If the universe of meanings given to the term genre does contain complementary uses, a meta-analysis will allow one to consider the consequences of the now arbitrary segregation of a superior metaconcept across disciplinary boundaries. Both sides of the divide could be strengthened by a cultural exchange of their respective terms. The redundancy of parallel discovery can be avoided.</p>
<p>Pathologies of disciplinarity can be diagnosed and treated. Disciplines are social substructures embedded in a larger society and culture. Disciplinarity is a kind of controlled ignorance exchanged for access to secret knowledge. The wayward uses of a term like genre are always lurking at the edges of the firelight defined by a particular disciplinary camp. Discipline as rigor instructs disciples to resist flirtations with the available complexity of the term. The essential tension is very rarely between what is known and unknown; rather it is more commonly between what is known “here” versus what we are conditioned to be willfully ignorant of “there”.</p>
<p>This definition of discipline is isomorphic with that of genre, in that disciplines are another form of categorical decision making, just at a higher level. Disciplines are supergenres that reflect the nesting of categories. What may distinguish them in a more serious way is the institutional underpinning of the category. If genres are formed by the categorical thinking of disciples, disciplines are formed by the categorical thinking of patrons, the powerful actors like university administrators, state legislators, and grantmakers who manage the economic foundation of scholarly careers, as well as the elite disciples who interface with these stakeholders. Where genre labels are inscribed onto cultural products, texts, discipline labels are inscribed onto cultural infrastructure like funding lines, buildings, and personnel themselves.</p>
<p>In a motivation of some of the arguments to follow, I take a metadisciplinary approach, which is to cast as wide a net as possible on the term genre. In so doing I hope to test the tacit cultural assumption that discipline-based decisions of relevance are valid, that is, that when we exclude arguments from other disciplines we remove distractions and focus on what is important. The alternative possibility is that we are wasting intellectual resources, because to exclude important work about our topic, even if it is codified in foreign terms, is to risk ignorance and redundancy. The topic is genre and how disciplinary boundaries form such that people using the same word nonetheless cannot communicate effectively. They draw on different paradigms, which is to say the term is not really the same term. What I hope to do is uncover the knowledge contexts surrounding the terms, and map these contexts in a way that enumerates the various communities of discourse and theories constituting the term.</p>
