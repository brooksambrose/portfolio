<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Generic isomorphism</h2>
<p>I have argued that the organization of knowledge into a complicated system of multiply epicentric disciplines and subfields is not only driven by the relevance of knowledge for the resolution of different intellectual problems, but that it is to a greater or lesser extent also driven by the resolution of the very social problem of maintaining group identity within scholarly fields. Professors guard these boundaries because their livelihoods are predicated on the existence of knowledge asymmetries. Educators erode them because their livelihoods depend on releasing knowledge to wider populations of learners. Archivists index them in order to serve as many interest groups as they can. The result is a relatively slowly evolving knowledge landscape that nevertheless develops stark topological features in time. None of these actors really has much of a reason to notice the wider knowledge landscape, and indeed it would be very difficult to achieve such a vantage point. Rather they are concerned with their local perspectives in the landscape. They are oriented to their knowledge work, and to the particular role relationships and the technologies, like the password list, that are used to enact and maintain those relationships.</p>
<p>There is one big exception to this rule of myopia, and that is the question of scholarly genre. Genres are classification systems held in common by all role incumbents. They are a form of ubiquitous knowledge that is the closest thing to a naturally occurring map of the field. In one sense the archivist is the guardian of the genre system and exploits it to develop indexing systems that actually work, that match likely requests from stakeholders to the actual content of the archive. But archivists do not invent genre labels, and neither does anyone else for that matter. They are a Wittgensteinian outcome of a long history of language games occurring among generations of role incumbents.</p>
<p>My theoretical ambition is to develop a perspective that does not reify the existence of genre categories, but rather seeks to explain them historically. To do this it is necessary to develop knowledge mapping techniques that are able to provide an independent basis for mapping the structures of knowledge as the are manifest in cultural archives themselves. The genres systems in existence during particular epochs cannot be taken as the truth on the ground, but are rather the outcomes of processes of social construction that are the true explicandum for sociological research. One might expect sociologists to have unique insight into the operations of a system they themselves inhabit, but on the contrary like all people who enact social structure their scientific understanding of it may collide with their successful performance of it.</p>
<p>I wish to conclude with a characterization of how the password and genre systems are actually experienced by people, and how little opportunity is ever given to reflect on or to imagine how their orientation to knowledge could be different. Let me begin again with the question that concerned me at the outset, how do scholars answer the question of what to read? I will show by illustration that the answer appears to depend very little on the topology of the knowledge landscape, and much more on the dynamics of the role relationships scholars must enter into. The landscape however is an ever present grounding on which the quotidian problems of scholarship play out, and often the knowledge must be present in its particular form for it to be exploited for actors’ narrower interests.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its knowledge-agnostic role in reifying social hierarchy, the password list is one answer to the question of what to read, and the rules for putting the list together are not entirely arbitrary. There are tacit conventions that both legitimate the password list within the profession and make it possible to recognize whether newly encountered work is relevant to the field. The password list answers the question of what to read only in a very narrow sense that guards the exterior of a scholarly field, the relationship between clergy and laity. Given password mastery, how then do professional scholars know what (not) to read as they extend the field while avoiding an internal erosion bubbling up from their own scholarly creativity? How do dislocated scholars coordinate their activity so as to produce self-similar work in the interests of the profession? There are several formal and informal structures that facilitate and compel scholars to make the same choices about what to read.</p>
<p>An obvious one is the supposed normative isomorphism of graduate program syllabi, which act like secret maps to navigate the archive. They are secret because they are not distributed freely by archivists but are rather cloistered within majors. These syllabi may or may not also teach the password of a field, a fact that may be difficult for students to discern. Universities tend to grant great autonomy to professors in writing syllabi, who in the course of their professional travails may not be given opportunities to read what they want. In being forced to carve out time with subordinates, faculty are caught between personal indulgence and a more or less strongly felt fiduciary responsibility to set students on the correct path. Students, having at most a weak basis for discerning whether a syllabus serves their interests or not, would have little recourse but to trust faculty even if that were not already built into the role relationship. If we have less than perfect faith in the strength of educational ethics among faculty, then we should expect that among graduate syllabi are many lists of what not to read. Students who trust too much in the formal curriculum may be lead astray, and even without trust, they may still be left ignorant of where to invest their labor.</p>
<p>In each graduate program there then must be a hidden curriculum, a map of the archive of higher quality than the formal syllabi. Where would such a curriculum be obtained? The provisional answer is that in the informal spaces of graduate programs knowledge of scholarly genre is learned from extracurricular engagement with professional conferences. It is in conference programs that the tacit rules of academic genre are learnable. These genres form the first parsing of the archive for neophytes. Indeed at the most generic level graduate students, if they are confident enough to locate themselves quickly, develop a taste for what not to read. Genre as the foundation for a taste for scholarship serves to restrict a student’s wandering to a delineable sector of the maze. If they can develop this proto-taste early enough in their careers, they will be armed with the stereotypes necessary to stop reading the wrong and start reading the right material. While this is not enough certainly to make clergy of laity, it is the first step.</p>
<p>Genre is the tacit essence of the password list, the interpretive code that is the taste for scholarship. Genre rules may be difficult to describe explicitly, and it is easier to argue about whether particular cultural items (ever available in the archive) are genre conforming or not. Genres bear labels that are too easy to reference, and when it comes time to describe their content it is those particular items whose classification status is unassailable that will serve to represent genre content, paradigms in the pre-Kuhnian sense of a primitive standard against which others may be compared.</p>
<p>The indulgences of syllabi are pejorative only in the sense that they represents genre nonconformity. Indeed scholarly indulgence may be educationally beneficial to students even while it is, as an opportunity cost, professionally wasteful. The opposite of generic here is not specific but rather idiosyncratic; a species has a known genre classification, whereas idiosyncrasy is unclassifiable, or at least unclassified. Indulgent idiosyncrasy, for instance the reading of a great book of a bygone era, may be very interesting especially when genre conforming content is boring precisely because it is generic. Yet for all its charm idiosyncrasy, if it cannot be accurately classified by professionals, does not advance professional interests. Students who wish to be educated may enjoy it, but those who wish to be professionalized ought to avoid it. So there is indeed a correct way to approach the archive, correct in the sense that certain draws establish eligibility to access scholarly professions. The reward relevant to neophytes is access to the first job, which if it can be secured grants access to facilities and some scope for indulgences.</p>
<p>This is not to say that students must directly encounter conference programs to learn genres. Genres may be communicated as stereotypes within local departmental codes and discourses. Such local cultures may either proudly or unwittingly contradict national genre standards, yet they will face perennial alignment challenges when departments interview candidates for jobs. Candidates have tailored themselves for a national market and will likely resemble the national genre code (that of our professional conference). Even if a candidate prepares a version of herself to convey the right “fit” in a particular locale, her actual scholarship will likely have been prepared for the generic rather than the specific audience. Thus while it may seem that the job holder would take priority over the job seeker, both contest and contestant have conditioned their expectations to maximize their appeal to as broad a field as possible.</p>
<p>The maximization strategy is simple: conform to the national genre system. The power of genre is this regulation of expectations across the supply and demand sides of the market. If either the local departmental culture or the candidate abrogates the national genre system with an indulgent idiosyncrasy, an exchange that would have been mere performance will devolve into a status challenge. The ornery party will have deflated the discursive potential that genres enable and will have raised the hackles of its interlocutors by requiring additional effort to recognize the unlabeled work before them. This cognitive tax created by the defiance of genre will need to be paid with a loan taken using one’s reputation as collateral.</p>
<p>The abrogation gambit is as risky for the contest as for the contestant, but to call it a gambit assumes a high level of sophistication. At one level genres are the most accessible form of knowledge in a cultural field. Everyone may know that classical is a genre of music without knowing much of anything about classical music. Knowing the label is the primitive form of genre knowledge; knowing how to categorize a particular unlabeled cultural object the next most primitive, and so on through gradations of knowledge that at the most advanced level reflect a performer’s ability to strategically mobilize genre conventions to control an audience’s experience. Nonetheless, the reputation sanction for genre abrogation will be assessed regardless of whether the performer colors wittingly or unwittingly outside of the lines.</p>
<p>Several fields of scholarship apply the term genre to describe or explain variations in content in other fields of cultural production, most commonly in literature and music. Though genres are commonly accepted to be classification systems in particular cultural domains, their ontology and hence validity tends to be assumed rather than demonstrated. Given fields of cultural production and consumption (or poiesis and esthesis depending on one’s discipline) that are prolific and innovative, one would expect genres to be soluble. In fact they are highly durable. The disciplinary structure of higher education offers an example of one of the more durable cultural classification systems. This durability of disciplines, this gelling of genres, has a force that is as powerful as it is difficult to explain. In this essay I have attempted to locate that durability in the structure of knowledge itself as it has been cultivated over generations. What is remarkable about the structure of this knowledge is that the mechanisms of exclusion that are enforced with and around it are not required by the knowledge itself. The great promise of the archive is the ability to combine knowledge in any way a seeker sees fit. The social structures within which access to the archive is organized have the curious effect of making it seem like most of those combinations are impossible.</p>
