<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Reading strata</h2>
<p>Table <a href="3-8-reading-strata.html#tab:hottable">3.18</a> provides a numerical summary of Figure <a href="3-7-topic-clusters.html#fig:hotleaf">3.21</a> replacing documents with their clusters and tabulating the number of documents in which a topic is dominant. The rows and columns are in the same order as the figure. Treating these 21 clusters as sampling strata is a more manageable research design than the above mentioned 45 to 90 pairwise strata and reflect the empirical reality that three way combinations are rare and that not all pairwise combinations are important. They also narrow us to a research question that is either diagnostic or substantive depending on what the qualitative content of texts holds. The substantive question is, how does the content of a topic change when discussed in isolation versus in combination? The diagnostic question is, what happens to the content of a topic when the when its documents are not well explained by the available topic context.</p>
<p>The difference is that the former assumes topic validity, whereas the latter make a different assumption about topic bias than we have previously discussed. In our diagnostics we were concerned that the low but nonzero probability terms of a topic by term vector represent sources of error and bias, for instance, due to idiosyncrasy. This was the body of the urchin. The problem with this kind of bias was that a generalization from the spine to body may be inappropriate because documents in the body actually represent classification errors and should not necessarily be understood to belong to the same class as their spines. Depending on the researcher’s goals this body bias may not have been too damning. If the topics that are learned are internally valid, and it is easy to identify the documents that they validly explain, then at least the researcher can claim to have understood some important portion of the corpus even if there remains a substantial unexplained portion.</p>
<p>Now we consider that it may also be possible that the spines are the bias inducing portions of the corpus. The logic here is that a text should never be categorized as nearly 100 percent derived from a topic, because this implies that it is 100 percent generic, that is, totally lacking in idiosyncrasy. What may be more likely is that those strongly classified documents are the ones that happen to not share any overlap with the other <em>available</em> topics. Since they must be 100 percent classified, in order for them to be classified anywhere the estimator may choose to distort the term vector to make special dispensation for these weird texts. This would imply that the texts that contain a mixture of a topic, rather than those wholly derivative of a topic, reflect the more valid portion of the term vector. If this kind of bias is indeed operative, then it poses a problem to the researcher, who will base her interpretation of a topic on the less valid portion of its texts.</p>
<p>Our stratification approach will allow us to adjudicate the question of validity by way of QCV. Each topic is represented by at least two strata, one mixed and one unmixed. We may compare the content of the unmixed texts to the topic portions of the mixed texts and assess whether they indeed reflect the same content. If they do, then the estimation is unbiased in at least this respect. If they are substantially different, and the unmixed documents appear less topic relevant than the mixed, then we have found a particular sort of bias due to underspecification of K.</p>

<p>Given the linear ordering of rows and columns, three seriation approaches are possible. <em>Inside out</em> would proceed from the lowest to the highest leaves when assessing topic relatedness, the lowest in this case being 4 and 7, and would emphasize the most interdependent topics first. Conversely <em>outside in</em> would start with the most independent topics. Finally, the easiest <em>playlist</em> seriation would simply be to read in the order given choosing either the top or bottom as a starting point.</p>
<p>We may now reflect on the guidance offered by Table <a href="3-5-diagnostics.html#tab:sumrnk">3.7</a>, where topics 6 and 9 had the best and topics 2 and 7 the worst performance across a battery of diagnostics. The clustering results bear the diagnostics out only in one respect. If good diagnostic performance meant a strong signal then it makes sense that topic 6 is</p>
<p>Figure <a href="3-8-reading-strata.html#fig:gen-samp">3.22</a> illustrates the use of these clusters as strata for a sampling approach to mastering a corpus defined by the term genre. The clusters are seriated in playlist order from left to right beginning with</p>
