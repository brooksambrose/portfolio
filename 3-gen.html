<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In English the term <em>genre</em> is a loanword from the French term for <em>kind</em>. As an analytical term in the social sciences genre is a loanword from the humanities. The use of the term varies greatly within and between disciplines. This study attempts a metadisciplinary literature review of genre as a term found in a corpus of JSTOR articles. I cast a very wide net by including any document in English that includes the term genre in the title or abstract. The resulting thousands of documents are “read” with the assistance of a statistical topic model to classify documents into topics, that is, strata of common vocabulary. Such stratification serves as a cartography of textual content, which allows one to generate a precise reading strategy. I use this text map to perform content analysis on a stratified sample of classified texts to compare their different uses of the term genre. In an examination of the benefits and hazards of this distant reading approach, I outline a battery of diagnostics to examine the validity of the topic model from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Through a combination of machine distant reading and human close reading, I conduct a provisional reading of texts in one region of the topic cartography, music. I show how the map usefully juxtaposes multiple disciplines as they discuss similar content, which makes comparative analysis more productive.</p>

<hr />
<p>The origin of the French-Latin word “genre” and the English-German word “kind” both mean membership by inheritance of innate class characteristics, archaically by presumptive blood descent within a family, race, or nation. In common English genre dates to 1770 and has been restricted to mean a broad category of art, especially literature and music. More recently it has been generalized to some but not all other cultural fields (e.g. baseball is not a genre of sports). As a term in scholarship, genre may be an observable phenomenon, a conceptual component of a theory, or a conflation of the two. In the social sciences genre is a specialty concept as in sociology, while in the humanities it is ubiquitous especially in cultural studies. Academics define and use the term differently between and within disciplines.</p>
<p>In its travels in American culture the term genre has passed first from its origin in the arts and literary studies, then into the popular parlance, and finally into the social sciences. The concept of genre was invented to help index and analyze texts by uncovering the immemorial traditions from which they descended. This image of cultural descent derived from the metaphor of genealogical descent that was the foundation of, for instance, ethnic nationalism. And in the same way that the genealogy of a person’s race could be inferred by the application of a classification rule to their personal characteristics, without actually knowing their genealogy, so too were artistic genres described in terms of a set of textual features.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that genre, gender, genesis, genealogy, and generation have a common root. What is underappreciated by sociologists is the essentialist underpinnings of each of the terms including genre. Without a handle on this term and a methodological and theoretical orientation to deploying it, it is easy to allow essentialism to be smuggled in to an analysis of culture the objective of which may be to explain rather than presume cultural forms.</p>
<p>Indeed the positing of a genre allowed scholars to collect texts and their authors into common categories and to then make a type that seems to describe what the items have in common. Their utility for the scholar of texts was in bringing order to disorganized materials, but what was difficult to predict was that these analytical tools would be reinscribed into the cultures they aimed to shed light on. This cultural recursion was then merely received by social scientists who have since stood on the shifting sands of using the term in its popular meaning without interrogating its literary meaning.</p>
<p>When compared to for instance racist reasoning, it may seem innocent to essentialize texts by applying genre labels to them. As the growth and differentiation of cultural production continued to accelerate especially in capitalist societies genre labels became indispensable for organizing markets. Cultural purists could no longer presume that, or presume to know if, seemingly new art forms are descended from tradition. The term eventually shifted away from a presumption of descent, but it did not lose its typifying, classifying, essentializing character.</p>
<p>In sociology at least neither the literary nor the popular uses of the terms are valid for scientific purposes. That is, sociologists should avoid the magic of classification that has been so carefully critiqued in the social construction tradition of Berger and Luckman <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Berger1966Social" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a>)</span>. Classification as a social process tends to create the self-similarity that it purports to describe. Genre labels condition the interpretation of a text’s characteristics to conform to the often tacit rules governing category membership. In so doing it also effaces differences that, were it not for the genre label, might appear to be essential to the constitution of the item.</p>
<p>The problem for sociologists arises when they attempt to have their cake and eat it too. A genre label is a powerful tool for simplifying cultural objects that may be overwhelming in the raw complexity of the knowledge they invoke or the perceptual stimulus they transmit. Schutz <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Schutz1970Reflections" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span> has shown that with experience people become excellent at sorting what they perceive according to its relevance to them. They do this in a process called typification, which is related to but not the same as classification. Typification is the learned association of a new object with a category that is equal to the memory of recently perceived objects. It is a chain of association. The act of memory is however an encryption, a portable and above all minimal description of the truth of a thing. To typify something is to link it to memory and experience, and also to occlude its novelty and force its familiarity.</p>
<p>Classification, on the other hand, is a culturally given category. It is the pattern of a type without need of experience of the type to learn it. What experience is needed is only of the act of classification itself. Classifications are learned by education or mimicry and can be instantiated in the mind prior to experience. Classifications promote a generalized dilettantism in societies by supercharging of the process of typification. What’s more, classification has the weight of society in it. Types may be idiosyncratic but classes are ubiquitous. Because classes provide a template for types, they are one mechanism by which social conformity may dominate personal idiosyncrasy. It may be very difficult for individuals who experience the world for the first time to not develop typifications that follow in the well trodden grooves of classifications.</p>
<p>The sociological agenda for investigating the term is simple; without studying what it means we cannot know how our use of it will be interpreted. Sociologists too often use genre as if it were a descriptive feature of the world. In fact it is a mystery that needs to be investigated. In this study I take a metadisciplinary approach to studying how different communities of scholars use the term genre. My method is to cast as wide a net as possible on the term genre. In so doing I hope to test the tacit cultural assumption that discipline-based decisions of relevance are valid, that is, that when we exclude arguments from other disciplines we remove distractions and focus on what is important. The alternative possibility is that we are wasting intellectual resources, because to exclude important work about our topic, even if it is codified in foreign terms, is to risk ignorance and redundancy. What I hope to do is uncover the knowledge contexts surrounding the terms, and map these contexts in a way that enumerates the various communities of discourse and theories constituting the term.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="3-gen.html#fig:ttsgnr">3.1</a> shows the count of mentions of the term genre in the Google Books Ngram database for English terms <span class="citation">(Michel et al. <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Michel2011Quantitative" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. The trend exhibits the typical take-off in publishing in the second half of the twentieth century. I apply change point analysis, which detects significant differences in time series data <span class="citation">(James and Matteson <a href="bibliography.html#ref-James2019ecp" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Matteson and James <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Matteson2013Nonparametric" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, to the second difference of the trend, a measure of acceleration, to get clues as to whether the trend is a single process or whether there are inflection points. The first segment of the curve from 1899 to 1984 indicates a period of positive acceleration or quickening of the growth trend. On average in the first period the rate of change from one year to the next increased by a modest 13.3 occurrences a year. However, during the period from 1985 to 2008 the rate of change, though always steep, began to decline by an average of 238.3 occurrences a year. Like a projectile that is simultaneously climbing and falling, 1984 acts as launch point of precipitous yet unsustainable growth.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="3-gen.html#fig:ttsgnr2">3.2</a> shows a similar trend but using relative frequencies instead of absolute counts. Here “genre” is plotted as its share of all terms in the corpus. This trend exhibits no inflection point at 1984 that is statistically significant, and visually the trend does appear the same on both sides. No other inflection points are detectable due likely to greater year over year variability in this series in the first half of the century, reducing confidence in any estimate of a change point. To interpret this difference in statistical significance between relative and absolute measures would indicate that interest in genre continued to grow even within a secular slow-down in the volume of texts that resembles the familiar S-shaped diffusion curve. Alternatively, on visual inspection of the relative curve it appears that indeed there is an inflection point, just one a decade later in 1996. After this point the relative frequency seems to drop rapidly, a change that would no doubt be picked up statistically after a few more years of data and one that may in fact be located a few years earlier than the peak suggests. Together these trends describe a career to the term genre that has been strong for a century and that may now be in decline.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="3-gen.html#fig:genre-goog">3.3</a> gives an indication of what things the term genre has been used to describe. It illustrates the frequency of terms appearing in the Google Books Ngram corpus as the third term in the trigrams beginning with “genre of” or “genres of” <span class="citation">(Google <a href="bibliography.html#ref-2012Google" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. The size of the words is proportional to the total frequency of the trigram in the English corpus, which spans centuries from 1590 to 2008. The bias of the source–books–is clear in the outsized importance of “literature” and “writing” which are followed closely by “music”. The next ten largest nouns are poetry, discourse, fiction, art, autobiography, painting, film, romance, folklore, and history. Ranked within that series would be several adjectives as well: popular, science (fiction), historical, and literary. Each of these terms refers to a field of concrete cultural products, with the exception of “discourse” which is more abstract.</p>

Figure 3.3: Wordcloud of third term in 3gram beginning with “genre of”.
</p>
</div>
<p>Most items toward the top of the list are less popular (to write about) art forms like television, dance, and theater. Toward the middle of the list begin to appear adaptations of the term from the cultural to the social context. These include practical fields like medicine and journalism, political areas like law, government, and crime, and social arenas like identity and protest.</p>
<p>In order to survey the use of the term genre across all of these varied contexts, I will require some help. In the next section I describe a computational approach to reading that will enable me to spend my reading budget wisely. This is easier said than done, and I will spend considerable time worrying about how to interpret a mathematical model of texts. After a lengthy methodological discussion I will return to a closer inspection of the diversity of the term.</p>
