# Getting Started {-}

Dear reader,

Welcome! This study is available as a website, https://brooksambrose.github.io/portfolio, and as a PDF document downloadable from the website. Both are great ways to read the study. The PDF makes for a quicker read, while the website offers additional interactivity in figures and tables that will help you dive more deeply into the exhibits.


```{r toolbar,fig.cap='Explore your options!', include=T}
knitr::include_graphics(ifelse(latex,'img/toolbar.png','img/toolbar.gif'))
```

At the top of the web page please notice a toolbar where you can:

* Show and hide the table of contents
* Search the document
* Adjust font and display settings
* View the underlying code at GitHub.com
* Download the PDF version

I hope you enjoy the study, and please feel free to report bugs, comment, and collaborate at the issue tracker of the GitHub repository.

Best,  
Brooks

(ref:abs-cit) Knowledge mapping of acadamic journals promotes the conservation of intellectual history and stimulates discovery of underexplored intellectual opportunities. Treated as a large network community detection problem, I demonstrate how to apply the clique percolation method to map two kinds of recorded knowledge: citations and full text. The features of generated maps are explained, and interpretive methods including visualization are presented. We use American social science scholarship in the first third of the 20th century prior to U.S. entry into World War II as a case, and describe how the intellectual landscape of four separate social science disciplines developed.
