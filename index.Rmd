### `r 'What to Read? How Archivists, Professors, and Educators Cultivate Knowledge Terrains'->tint;tint`

(ref:abs-int) As scholarly fields of cultural production grow their discourses tend to undergo a phase transition where hot global tele-communication breaks down into cool parochial epicentrism. I describe three structures--archives, profession, and education--whose relationships explain the social and cultural forces leading to the opening up and closing off of scholarly discourses. Given an archival context, where expansive media collections give unlimited scope to potential conversation topics, education tends to heat to a boil and profession tends to cool to a condensation of discourses. When such discursive tendencies (genres) are embedded in universities (disciplines) the attendant competition over resources pits professionals against educators and makes it possible to arrest cultural dynamism into relatively static historical configurations. <!--Such a social domestication of cultural wildness allows knowledge to be harnessed for economic purposes, namely workforce development (teaching) and product design (research), and sometimes for political ends. These heteronomous interests in predictable output from universities depresses their cultural generativity.--> Such macroscopic historical tendencies are difficult for the local agents of their development to recognize; their myopic experience in university arenas is that of status conflicts around investments in academic genres and fiscal conflicts around investments in disciplinary personnel. Using the focal question scholars new and old must answer--"What to read?"--I posit the genre-like qualities of scholarly discourses and suggest the cognitive, institutional, and social, that is disciplinary, consequences of adhering to or abrogating genre conventions.

### `r 'Social Science Disciplines Today'->tdis;tdis`

(ref:abs-dis) Social science is arranged into disciplines in a manner similar to the genre systems of commercial fields of cultural production (FCP) like music, yet evolving at a slower pace. Genres appear static and given in the form of the labeling schemes of archivists and librarians. Such schemes aim to describe academic genres objectively, yet in so doing referencers and indexers reify them historically. Such genre classifications are at times useful, frustrating, or didactic for the academic "disciples" or knowledge workers of higher education. This study maps the cognitive system of genre classifications in one particular labeling scheme, that of the JSTOR historical archive, as applied to one aspect of academic FCPs, journals. The patterns of interdisciplinary cross labeling, of allowing journals to bear multiple labels, are represented as a network and then visualized to reveal how global axes among science, social science, and humanities condition the local relationships of disciplines like sociology and anthropology.

### `r 'Genre and the Literature'->tgen;tgen`

(ref:abs-gen) In English the term *genre* is a loanword from the French term for *kind*. As an analytical term in the social sciences genre is a loanword from the humanities. The use of the term varies greatly within and between disciplines. This study attempts a metadisciplinary literature review of genre as a term found in a corpus of JSTOR articles. I cast a very wide net by including any document in English that includes the term genre in the title or abstract. The resulting thousands of documents are "read" with the assistance of a statistical topic model to classify documents into topics, that is, strata of common vocabulary. Such stratification serves as a cartography of textual content, which allows one to generate a precise reading strategy. I use this text map to perform content analysis on a stratified sample of classified texts to compare their different uses of the term genre. In an examination of the benefits and hazards of this distant reading approach, I outline a battery of diagnostics to examine the validity of the topic model from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Through a combination of machine distant reading and human close reading, I conduct a provisional reading of texts in one region of the topic cartography, music. I show how the map usefully juxtaposes multiple disciplines as they discuss similar content, which makes comparative analysis more productive.

### `r 'Economy, Society, and Vocabulary: The Origins of U.S. Anthropology and Sociology, 1888-1922'->tvoc;tvoc`

(ref:abs-voc) After the American Civil War, United States social science scholarship shifted its institutional basis from museums, learned societies, and government and military agencies to a more autonomous setting in the newly forming university system. Throughout this transition, journals served as a platform for the distribution of scholarly knowledge, giving coherence and continuity to a field otherwise very much in flux. This study lays out two levels of context for these developments. First at the national level we describe the broader societal shifts in politics and the economy that corresponded to an increase in public demand for knowledge, which in turn provided new resources to expand production in the social sciences. Second, at the level of social science discourse as represented by journal articles, we show how the attention of social scientists shifted in response to social problems. Using 35 years of full text data from the leading journals in anthroplogy and sociology, we use topic models to first classify and count fields of research and then to describe their waxing and waning in the lead up to World War I. In order to develop this novel "census of knowledge", we apply new approaches to determining the number of scholarly fields by leveraging variations in vocabularies as signals of social boundary formation within fields of cultural production.

### `r 'The Social Science Citation Landscape, 1900-1940'->tcit;tcit`

(ref:abs-cit) Knowledge mapping of academic journals promotes the conservation of intellectual history and stimulates discovery of underexplored intellectual opportunities. Treated as a large network community detection problem, I demonstrate how to apply the clique percolation method to map two kinds of recorded knowledge: citations and full text. The features of generated maps are explained, and interpretive methods including visualization are presented. We use American social science scholarship in the first third of the 20th century prior to U.S. entry into World War II as a case, and describe how the intellectual landscape of four separate social science disciplines developed.

`r tten<-'The Development of Intensive Referencing'`

### `r tten` {-}

(ref:abs-ten) Early in the history of the U.S. social sciences, scholars tended to extend the space of references into new territories. After a transition point in the 1920s, they shifted toward an intensive pattern of citation where scholars routinely retraced well-trodden steps in the citation space. The transition coincides with the development of professional labor markets in the social sciences.
