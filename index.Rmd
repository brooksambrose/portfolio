Welcome! This study is available as a website, https://brooksambrose.github.io/portfolio, and as a PDF document downloadable from the website. Both are great ways to read the study. The PDF makes for a quicker read, while the website offers additional interactivity in figures and tables that will help you dive more deeply into the exhibits.


```{r toolbar,fig.cap='Explore your options!', include=T}
knitr::include_graphics(ifelse(latex,'img/toolbar.png','img/toolbar.gif'))
```

At the top of the web page please notice a toolbar where you can:

* Show and hide the table of contents
* Search the document
* Adjust font and display settings

`r tint<-'Genre and the Literature'`

### `r tint` {-}

(ref:abs-int) There are many different analytic approaches to the phenomenon of genre classification of cultural products. This study explores how the use of the term genre varies across a wide swath of humanities and social science publications. I use computational text analysis to classify articles in the JSTOR archive into groups of common vocabulary. I use these groups as strata for a sampling approach to content analysis of the "entire" corpus of literature using the term genre. Through a combination of machine distant reading and human close reading, I arrive at a theory of five genres of the term genre. In an argument for pandisciplinarity, I conclude with an analysis of the logical possibility of new metaconcepts of genre that satisfy the strictures of multiple genres.

`r tgen<-'Social Science Genres Today'`

### `r tgen` {-}

(ref:abs-gen) Social science is arranged into disciplines in a manner strikingly similar to the genre systems of commercial fields of cultural production (FCP) like music, yet evolving at a slower pace. Genres appear static and given in the form of the labeling schemes of archivists and librarians. Such schemes aim to describe academic genres objectively, yet in so doing referencers and indexers reify them historically. Such genre classifications are at times useful, frustrating, or didactic for the academic "disciples" or knowledge workers of higher education. This study maps the cognitive system of genre classifications in one particular labeling scheme, that of the JSTOR historical archive, as applied to one aspect of academic FCPs, journals. The patterns of interdisciplinary cross labeling, of allowing journals to bear multiple labels, reveal how global axes among science, social science, and humanities condition the local relationships of disciplines like sociology and anthroplogy.

`r tcit<-'The Social Science Citation Landscape, 1900-1940'`

### `r tcit` {-}

(ref:abs-cit) Knowledge mapping of acadamic journals promotes the conservation of intellectual history and stimulates discovery of underexplored intellectual opportunities. Treated as a large network community detection problem, I demonstrate how to apply the clique percolation method to map two kinds of recorded knowledge: citations and full text. The features of generated maps are explained, and interpretive methods including visualization are presented. We use American social science scholarship in the first third of the 20th century prior to U.S. entry into World War II as a case, and describe how the intellectual landscape of four separate social science disciplines developed.

`r tten<-'The Development of Intensive Referencing'`

### `r tten` {-}

(ref:abs-ten) Early in the history of the U.S. social sciences, scholars tended to extend the space of references into new territories. After a transition point in the 1920s, they shifted toward an intensive pattern of citation where scholars routinely retraced well-trodden steps in the citation space. The transition coincides with the development of professional labor markets in the social sciences.
