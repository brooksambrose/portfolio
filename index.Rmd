# Getting Started {-}

Dear reader,

Welcome! This study is available as a website, https://brooksambrose.github.io/portfolio, and as a PDF document downloadable from the website. Both are great ways to read the study. The PDF makes for a quicker read, while the website offers additional interactivity in figures and tables that will help you dive more deeply into the exhibits.


```{r toolbar,fig.cap='Explore your options!', include=T}
knitr::include_graphics(ifelse(latex,'img/toolbar.png','img/toolbar.gif'))
```

At the top of the web page please notice a toolbar where you can:

* Show and hide the table of contents
* Search the document
* Adjust font and display settings
* View the underlying code at GitHub.com
* Download the PDF version

I hope you enjoy the study, and please feel free to report bugs, comment, and collaborate at the issue tracker of the GitHub repository.

Best,  
Brooks

<!-- There are two reasons to map knowledge spaces. First, we may want to know how knowledge develops as a resource unto itself. Second, we may want to exploit such a map for a productive purpose. Here we will attempt the second as prologue to the first. We will tackle the technical problems of constructing a map. We will show how a map can be put to use. Finally, we will investigate how the particular map we make may tend to predictably get us lost.  -->

<!-- ### Abstracts {-} -->

<!-- `r tpe<-'Profession against Education: Knowledge as Influence'` -->

<!-- #### Chapter 1: `r tpe` {-} -->

<!-- (ref:pe-abs) Status reflects a person's generalized ability or inability to accrue resources to herself over the claims of others. Social institutions define the conditions of status attainment, and different institutions validate statuses according to different norms, truths, and values. Knowledge as a valued resource forms a basis of status hierarchies in two institutions in American society: profession and education. This essay explains how knowledge mediates social relationships to stabilize status hierarchies differently in professions and in education. It also describes how stability of status hierarchies depends on a qualified segregation of these institutions, as the norms of one can be corrosive to the norms of the other. -->

(ref:abs-kd) Knowledge development of journals is measured as the change in topic prevalence over time.

<!-- `r tkm<-'Knowledge Mapping'` -->

<!-- #### Chapter 3: `r tkm` {-} -->

<!-- (ref:abs-km) Knowledge mapping of acadamic journals promotes the conservation of intellectual history and stimulates discovery of underexplored intellectual opportunities. Treated as a large network community detection problem, I demonstrate how to apply the clique percolation method to map two kinds of recorded knowledge: citations and full text. The features of generated maps are explained, and interpretive methods including visualization are presented. We use American social science scholarship in the first third of the 20th century prior to U.S. entry into World War II as a case, and describe how the intellectual landscape of four separate social science disciplines developed. -->
