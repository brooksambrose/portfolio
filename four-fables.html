<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Four Fables</h1>
<p>What were the dominant ideas at the genesis of U.S. social research? How would we know them if we found them? I consider two sets of approaches, the first methodological (how?), and the second ontological (what, why?), which will help orient us to the plan of the study. I will briefly describe a version of the familiar distinctions among qualitative and quantitative methods on one hand and nomathetic and idiographic ontologies on the other. What is new is the question of whether computational text analysis may blur the lines between these classic social science epistemologies.</p>
<div id="method-or-the-tortoise-and-the-hare" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Method <em>or</em> The Tortoise and the Hare</h2>
<p>Methods are procedures for arriving at results, and they act by exposing assumptions to empirical observations. They provide a source of influence on arguments that breaks the circularity of their reasoning. Methods differ in the amount of material exposed to the observer and the speed of its exposure. The difference between human and machine learning concerns both, but speed is especially salient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You may deride my awkward pace,<br />
But <em>slow and steady</em> wins the race.”<br />
– Robert Lloyd <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lloyd1762Poems">1762</a>:38)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lloyd’s creatures correctly describe the consequences of haste.</p>
<p>First consider a humanist, a historian, a scholar with sense enough to read primary source material. How would she proceed to conduct an intellectual history? Slow and steady, a tortoise would identify diverse documentary sources allowing her to collect the names of important people and organizations and learn what she could of their biographical facts and event timelines. She would then read the scholarship both produced and consumed by these important actors. The identification of ideas would be the most difficult of her tasks, not just because reading takes time and effort (and there would be much of it), but because ideas exist in the minds of people and leave no direct empirical trace. The interpretation of writing in a historical context would suggest candidate ideas; their prevalence across time and place would indicate their historical importance. It would be tedious work requiring intelligence and patience.</p>
<p>Next consider a sociologist, a computer scientist, a librarian awash in books with no time to read them. She would identify a convenient source and ask a computer to do the rest. Hasty, impudent, and lacking the tortoise’s fortitude and patience, a hare uses a mental prosthetic to achieve and perhaps exceed the scale at which a humanist can consume documentation. She learns much less than the tortoise because, whereas people can find what they were not looking for, machines can learn only what they are told to learn. She fails in the test of knowledge (of course we know who wins in the end), but at least she fails quickly.</p>
<p>For shorthand, we can refer to these two approaches are Aesop’s tortoise and hare, the humanist mode and the computational mode.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="ontology-or-the-fox-and-the-hedgehog" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Ontology <em>or</em> The Fox and the Hedgehog</h2>
<p>So we might learn more slowly or less quickly, but what will we be trying to learn, and why? These concerns the question of ontology. Ontologies are categories of being, or more simply, they are the assumptions that answer the (usually implicit) question, “What is this?”. Ontologies may be descriptive categories of classification or explanatory causal mechanisms. It is neither possible to describe nor explain without making onotological assumptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The fox knows many things,<br />
but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”<br />
– Isaiah Berlin<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Berlin1953Hedgehog">1953</a>:1)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here two of Berlin’s creatures will help show two different ontological approaches.</p>
<p>Third, consider a surveyor, an ethnographer, a data scientist. A fox believes that the world is nothing but the facts about it. She sets out to learn something about everything, and in so doing she tends to locate where the action happens to be without having known it was there to begin with. Though she can only skim for surface features, a fox’s shallower understanding of many things is usually very helpful. A fox learns where the important, useful, or interesting things in the world are hidden.</p>
<p>Fourth, consider a theorist, a statistician, a case worker. A hedgehog learns something, but not necessarily everything, about something. They know less than a fox, but if they are a good hedgehog then what they know is good enough. A hedgehog experiences the world in filtered fashion, bothering to remember only what contributes to her system or her obsession.</p>
<p>So let us run Aesop’s race again, but make it a three-legged race competing in teams. And to add some purpose above crossing the finish line, the party set an objective. The teams must gather fruit to bring back to the table for supper. Who would win? Hare and hedgehog of course, for they knew a big melon would provide more than their share, which they found at a farm stand down the road. The real contest was for second place. Hare and fox set out at once to forage, darting furiously here and there to gather a great assortment of wild nuts and berries. There were many mouths to feed and each morsel was small, so they had to be dedicated to growing a larder. Tortoise and hedgehog heard tale of a durian, the spiked and malodorous king of fruits, and thought it fit well with hedgehog’s general motif; but they did not sell them at the country market so they walked into town looking for an importer. They returned at sunset, durian in tow, to find hare and fox laying exhausted atop an impressive heap of produce that hare and hedgehog had clearly been snacking on while they idled the afternoon away. Sadly tortoise and hare never even placed; they had thought it prudent to plant a garden of their own and left for the seed store with no intention of returning to the party. In a few years time they intended to be the life of the potlach.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<div id="plan-of-the-study-or-a-three-legged-table" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Plan of the Study <em>or</em> A Three-Legged Table</h2>
<p>So in four corners of a table, three were full of different produce and in one lay only a promise.</p>

<p>Understanding differences in the ontological status of the “topic” concept is a good way to begin to understand how this method of analysis is used by researchers.</p>
<p>Analysts have conceptualized the use of topic models in very different ways. Some researchers treat topics as useful for a particular purpose and not as true descriptions of real phenomena. Topics as information enhances the ability to search for relevant documents or statistical trends in otherwise unwieldy corpora as a time-saving alternative to manually reading large collections. <span class="citation">(Boyd-Graber, Hu, and Mimno <a href="#ref-Boyd-Graber2017Applications">2017</a>)</span> Empirical problems, used as demonstrations of statistical techniques, have included</p>

</div>
<p>This is the “needle and haystack” approach favored by computer and information scientists who tend not to be interested in theoretical intepretations beyond the statistical definitions of topics.</p>
<p>Other researchers instead grant topics ontological status, and these can be divided into three types. Most ambitiously, topics may be treated as representing categories of thought. Latent semantic structure latent semantic structure <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="WallachStatisticalTopicModels2011"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> representational style <span class="citation">(Grimmer <a href="#ref-Grimmer2016Measuring">2016</a>)</span> frame <span class="citation">(DiMaggio, Nag, and Blei <a href="#ref-DiMaggio2013Exploiting">2013</a>)</span></p>
<p>Text as thought, or as communication. Thought holds that the ideas can be reliably interpreted, perhaps hermeneutically, to recover the mental events or intentions of authors and readers. Ambitious. Easier is to treat texts as communications, as messages, and worry little about their meanings or interpretations. A study of communication is a good foundation for the study of thought, but it is a separate task and the one we undertake here.</p>
