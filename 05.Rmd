## subhead

For every year, find distribution of bibliography size.
We will draw from this to show the effect of variation in bibliography lengths. We may already surmise that extreme values will create some instability.

For every year, find edge weight distribution, including zeroes.

Find size of total "space" in which edes might be laid down. Find total number of co-citations.

Simulate simple poisson in that space.

Compare to simulation of actually bibliographies in that space.

Test hypothesis that there is a move from extensive to intensive development.
