<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Disciplines</h1>
<p>Computational text analysis requires that text corpora be transformed from a human to a machine readable format. Several efforts to digitize paper archives have made historical research designs possible, notably the Google Books project, HathiTrust, and ITHAKA JSTOR archive. Digital storage devices like the portable document format (PDF) have also enabled texts to be represented in both a digital version and as a reasonable facsimile of paper originals. Reasonable, we should say, for most sociological purposes, put not for other historical questions where materiality of culture is important. <span class="citation">(Schreibman <a href="#ref-Schreibman2014NonConsumptive">2014</a>:149)</span></p>
<p>Digital archives make research into the production of culture difficult, precisely because they misrepresent several aspects of the means of production. Because researchers should be mindful that digitization of texts abstracts some qualities of texts and renders many others invisible. The importance of physical space and material qualities of libraries is illegible when working with digital archives, while the verbal content of texts is highlighted. We must keep in mind that we are not viewing what historical actors saw. Digital texts are almost perfectly fungible, while, variability in historical texts. We are liable, for instance, to underestimate the search costs to locate texts, and the fungibility of texts themselves.</p>
<p>There are reasons, however, to believe that digital text archives provide not just a useful but an historically valid abstraction from the material texts. If we want to understand how an individual scholar understood a particular text, better to have her personal copy, margin notes and all. Yet how would that scholar have treated the text as a cultural item? She would abstract her own copy to a format credibly held in common, the more aniseptically clean version that we see in digital archives. These are the ghosts of the texts, so to speak, but they are what would be left when all idiosyncracies were removed, the version that one would assume colleagues thought of when declaring that text publically.</p>
<!-- This comment on evidentiary foundations introduces the theme of this paper, which is the difference between personal and social meanings of texts, and more generally how tendencies toward idiosyncracy attenuate those toward conformity, and vice versa. -->
<p>This is by way of saying that the texts I compile below are not the same that were read by the historical actors under consideration. They are the texts that historical actors would assume their contemporaries were reading, that is, the sanitized, fungible, original published form of the text. By getting at these texts, we are getting at the real historical infrastructure for scholarly communication.</p>
<p>The optical character recognition that computers require in order to store text digitally depends critically on the hard work of creating quality scans of journal archives. JSTOR has done a comendable job of this. Next we will describe what the JSTOR archive has to offer.</p>
<div id="kd-dq1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> JSTOR Journals</h2>
<p>We rely on the JSTOR digital archive which gives access to optical scans of historical journals. JSTOR provides a title list of their journal coverage <span class="citation">(JSTOR <a href="#ref-JSTOR2018Title">2018</a>)</span>. The coverage of journals in the archive is very complete for those journals chosen for the database. As of this writing JSTOR contained 4,162 different journal titles and 2,706 journals from 1,121 different publishers. The different journal counts are due to some journals changing titles at least once.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <!--TODO add sentence concatenator to tilit--> These journals are organized into nine superdisciplines under which may be found 70 disciplines.</p>
<p>Most journals are given more than one discipline label, and the superdisciplines are not marked as such in the database creating some redundancy. For instance, a journal labeled as “Sociology” will also be labeled as “Social Sciences”. Most academics will be familiar with whether a label is for a superdiscipline or a subdiscipline, yet for outsiders or for skeptical insiders, the only clue is in the frequency with which a label is applied. Counting labels, however, does not unambiguously place a journal in one discipline or another because journals may bear multiple labels, even multiple superdiscipline labels.</p>
<p>To assess the size of the disciplines and to disentangle their hierarchies it will be helpful to have a mutually exclusive labeling scheme that draws on the JSTOR curators’ judgement while simplifying it.</p>
</div>
<div id="network-mode-projection" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Network Mode Projection</h2>
<p>I rely on network methods to accomplish this labeling in a data driven and reproducible way. First I projected the journals as a bimodal network with journals in the first mode bearing ties to discipline labels in the second mode. I then projected the bimodal network into two unimodal networks, one where journals are connected by ties equal to the number of discipline labels they have in common, and another where labels are tied by the number of articles carrying both labels. Call each of these unimodal networks, the (<em>journal-label-journal</em>) journal network and (<em>label-journal-label</em>) label network, a facet of the original bimodal network.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="kd-d.html#fig:mod-proj">3.1</a> illustrates the effects of network mode projection on a random sample of 300 edges. The first panel illustrates the bimodal network where journals are yellow dots and labels blue dots. As an artifact of sampling, most journals here are shown tied to only one label. In fact this is never the case in the full network; as each journal has at least one discipline and one superdiscipline label the minimum number of labels is two, the median case accounting for 53.6 percent of journals. The most labels any journal bears is 10, but these are outliers with most journals bearing only a few labels.</p>

</div>
<p>It is worth noting a few features of unimodal projections. First, unimodal projections will always be made of up of overlapping cliques. Take the journal facet; each journal bearing a particular label will be tied to every other journal with the same label, and together they will form a maximal clique, a subnetwork where all possible ties exist. Such cliques grow nearly exponentially, as each additional journal with the same label joins the clique and adds a number of ties equal to the former size of the clique. Practically, very common labels like “Social Sciences” can easily dominate a network. Here the weighting of edges becomes important; if two labels overlap because some nodes bear both labels, then within the intersection of the two groups the ties may “weigh more” by adding the contribution of each label separately. Using methods that take edge weights into account is a good way to ameliorate the exponential influence of popular labels.</p>
<p>Second, though unimodal facets of a bimodal network represent the same data, each may have different characteristics especially in the common case of a large population imbalance between modes. Here we have 34 times as many journals as labels and each journal sends multiple ties. This degree imbalance between the two modes may mean that one facet is more dense than its inverse. Density is the proportion of actual ties out of all possible ties. An imbalance may be observed in the sample network where the journal facet has many dense and interconnected cliques and where the label network appears to be mostly made of isolated labels save for the few larger components. Here the journal facet is eight times more dense than the label facet.</p>
<p>While each of the isolates in the label facet represents a larger or smaller number of journals (se the free floating cliques observable in the journal facet) they supply no information about interdisciplinarity. Practically, analyzing the journal network highlights the population sizes, while analyzing the label network highlights interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>In the case of our full network, the potential imbalance in degree distribution between facets happens to be offset by the population imbalance itself. The densities in the full journal and label facets are comparable, 26 and 27 percent respectively, meaning that analysis will not merely hinge on which facet is analyzed.</p>
</div>
<div id="network-community-detection" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Network Community Detection</h2>
<p>With our facets in hand we may now tackle the problem of partitioning the JSTOR journals into mutually exclusive disciplines. I define disciplines as clustering within each of the two facet networks. I conducted community detection–a set of network methods that classify nodes according to the dense subnetworks they occupy–to cluster each network and reveal patterns in JSTOR’s labeling policy. (See appendix <a href="#a-louvain">?</a> for technical details.) The goal was to confirm the expectation of which labels counted as superdisciplines, or to learn a different classification scheme if the results were surprising.</p>

<p>The results in Table <a href="kd-d.html#tab:jclu-tab-sup">3.1</a> are achieved by partitioning the <em>journal</em> network into the detected clusters, and then by assigning each cluster the name of its most frequent label. The learned labels refine the superdisciplines by making them mutually exclusive, as is apparent by the sum of the given labels exceeding 100%. The cluster labels comport with a commonsensical understanding of superdisciplines. Social Sciences journals predominate due to JSTOR’s initial focus in that area, even without counting economics among them. Business &amp; Economics marks the transition from the larger academic journal space to the smaller professional space.</p>
<p>Clustering of the label facet presents a similar view. Recall that each facet represents the same data, the difference being whether a journal or a label is represented as a node or an edge. The larger population of journals is easier to partition it into a greater number of subpopulations. Converseley, because there are far fewer labels than journals, we would expect the clustering to be less granular for the label network than for the journal network. In fact there is only one fewer clusters, with the difference being Law.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="kd-d.html#fig:jclu-lnet">3.2</a> shows a graph of the relationships among labels, where again the strength of ties is equal to the number of journals bearing both labels. Again community detection partitions the network into its most dense subregions. Here the the label with highest degree is assigned to the category and then ommited as a node. Astronomy, an isolate that never accompanies another label, is also ommited from the graph, resulting in four superdiscipline categories.</p>

Figure 3.2: Discipline Network (Residual Latent Space controlling for Sociality)
</p>
</div>
<p>Here some of the granular categories are collapsed. The humanities includes arts, as we might expect, but also area studies, which one might have classed with the social sciences, but which bear stronger ties to cultural studies like music, folklore, religion, and language and literature. Law and medicine and allied health are grouped with the social sciences, and business and economics is maintained as separate field due merely to the attachment of three professional fields–development studies, management and organizational behavior, and marketing and advertising–to their parent disciplines business and economics (not to be confused with the separate and ommitted label “business and economics”), which are themselves strongly tied to the social sciences.</p>
<p>Though graph layouts are imperfect and should not be overinterpreted, the global features of facing within clusters do indicate the disciplines that straddle boundaries. On the border between the social sciences and science and mathematics are the social sciences dealing most with the physical problems of space, health, and technology. On the edge of the humanities and social sciences are history, philosophy, and anthropology.</p>

Figure 3.5: Number of PhDs conferred in the United States per Social Science Journal
</p>
</div>
<p>This period represents one of stable growth, as the size of the field grows with the number of players on it. Between 1888 and 1922 there tended to be about seven new PhDs in the U.S. for every social science journal even as each population grew year over year. These growth patterns begin to diverge around 1920 as a decades long acceleration of personnel begins, relatively slowly between 1920 and 1960 at an average acceleration rate of 22 PhDs per journal per year, and then quite precipitously in the 1960s at an average acceleration rate of 121.</p>
