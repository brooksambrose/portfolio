<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>What were the ideas that predominated in the social sciences at their formation as professions in the postbellum United States? What was the course of their development over a generation of scholarship? In this study I will answer these questions inductively through a reading of the original journals in each discipline. Though the goal is substantive, the methodological challenges of consuming a large quantity of text will feature importantly in the story that unfolds. Along the way I will demonstrate the usefulness of the computational <em>distant reading</em> that is being explored in the humanities and how it can be combined with traditional textual analysis for social science purposes. While controversial in humanistic circles that emphasize the primacy of the reader’s novel interpretive work when consuming text, distant reading fits comfortably within a social science epistemology that aims to achieve an objective description of intellectual history. Indeed, computational methods offer a useful backstop to the idiosyncrasy of a particular person’s reading of history.</p>
<p>Computational textual analysis promises to automate a particular slice of what hermeneutical methods accomplish. Hermeneutics claims that through historical methods it is possible to reconstruct the interpretive context of texts such that they can be understood in the same way that contemporary historical actors understood them. Establishing such context is a laudable yet arduous feat of historical research to uncover the social and intellectual milieu of a particular text. This is the gold standard approach, but one that restricts the field to specialists with the training and resources necessary for the undertaking.</p>
<p>Computers cannot study history in this way. What they can do, however, is mine source material for limited kinds of contexts. The kind I am concerned with below are the <em>historical vocabularies</em> that writers used to construct texts in historical time. Vocabularies are glyphs without grammar; they do not mean anything, but nothing meaningful can be said without them in the present or in the past. They are the mediated form of language, and in communicating with each other historical actors leave traces that survive perfectly in time so long as texts themselves survive.</p>
<p>While computers cannot read meaning in texts, and can barely recognize it, they are almost as good as humans at recognizing the glyphs of texts, and vocabularies are nothing but glyphs. What computers lack in smarts, they make up in speed and memory. The quantitative scale of their recognition makes for a qualitative shift in that vocabularies can be enumerated across immense corpora of texts. Immense, at least, by human standards as there are limits to even computer memory and speed. Yet such enumeration of texts into objective historical categories; this is a profound resource for the intellectual historian. That one could begin a reading with such context would be a transformative research tool. Vocabulary enumeration, by which I mean simply the counting and classifying of texts according to the vocabularies they contain, invites a population studies approach to intellectual history. Where sense-making is driven by comparisons, a reader’s arbitrary combination of texts is guaranteed to lead to anachronism. But if we can know that texts are relevant to each other without knowing why, we have done some small amount of hermeneutical work by supplying texts as historically correct context to each other.</p>
<p>And even going so far as abandoning the project of reading texts in a historically correct way, vocabulary enumeration can still lend objectivity to a novel construction, a productive anachronism, of textual meaning. Because vocabularies, the problems solved by computers, are mathematically, algorithmically, or stochastically determined, they may provide an immutable description of corpora that, like a map, enables individual and collective exploration within a common framework. Such maps may become the parameters of interpretive methods, which we may use to surface and control some of our subjectivity.</p>
<p>This at least is the rationale for what follows. I begin with a discussion of intellectual history of two social sciences, anthropology and sociology, in the United States. I take a coarse view of national history as the history of wars because of their downstream effects on government activity and institutional investments. The first period is between the end of the American Revolution (1783) and the end of the American Civil War (1865) and is the national context for the origin of U.S. anthropology. The second period is after the Civil War until the end of World War I (1918) and is the context for the origin of U.S. sociology and of modern U.S. higher education generally. Wars of territorial expansion are waged regularly during both periods against native peoples and rival colonial empires, and social research was always recruited to solve attendant problems of population and to provide rationales for the relationships with and understandings of conquered or would-be conquered people.</p>
<p>I use intellectual histories of anthropology to characterize the prebellum period, and the same for the postbellum period including sociology. The most important journals in each field date from the postbellum period, and the appearance of each is implicated in the project of professionalization for each discipline. The 1920s marked the end of war with the last of the militating American Indian tribes, and a reckoning with the darkest sides of industrialization laid bare by WWI. Social research had by this time completed a shift from colonial to industrial problems and enjoyed a golden decade of development as a profession, punctuated by the next great historical crisis in the Great Depression. With the 1920s begins the adolescence of social research, which is beyond the present scope. This study is of its childhood, which ends with the Great War. I however draw the study out until 1922 because it is the end of the public domain in U.S. copyright, to aid in the reproducibility of the analysis and so that all readers may recover the texts in question without difficulty.</p>
<div id="topics-ideas" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Topics ≟ Ideas</h2>
<p>The strategy of the following analysis occurs in four steps.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sort text into categories of similar vocabulary.</li>
<li>Describe the vocabularies that define category membership.</li>
<li>Describe vocabulary prevalence across time and discipline.</li>
<li>Validate category contents by a traditional qualitative reading of texts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 1-3 constitute a normal approach to quantitative intellectual history, whereas step 4 is seldom attempted. If in this way we may operationalize the notion of cultural meaning or cultural logic as conformity to vocabularies, then a new horizon of intellectual scholarship is possible that would allow a so-called “distant reading” of texts. If on the other hand we find that machine learned vocabularies do not correspond to human learned understandings of the texts drawing on those vocabularies, then we may in fact discover that distant reading is not a scientific, historical, or hermenuetical method, but rather a new humanistic method of reading texts de novo.</p>
<p>A population study of ideas at a societal scale has never been conducted in the social sciences.</p>
<p>Topic modeling refers to a variety of approaches to the statistical modeling of texts that blurs the distinction between qualitative and quantitative analysis. Texts are merely collections of terms (usually words) that are counted, and such counts may describe a text. In the same way that a civil census reduces communities to counts of the people who live in them, topic modeling reduces texts to a count of words, to diction. And just as a census of people fails to capture the nuanced interactivity of human settlements found in their culture, politics, and economic activity, the meanings and intentions behind words are washed away. At a very general level this term census paints a lexographic picture of texts, analogous to the demographic picture gained by a survey census of cities and towns. This approach to document description is sometimes called a “bag of words”.</p>
<p>To explain the contents of the bag-of-word, topics are proposed. Topics can be thought of as catelogs out of which words are ordered and placed into the shopping cart that is the document. Different catelogs, different word availabilities, will produce different documents. The final bit of inference that makes topic models so practically useful is the idea that documents may be composed of multiple topics.</p>
<p>The surprising qualities of texts are explained to be how authors draw on regular and commonplace topics to say something different.</p>
