<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Network Visualization</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="2-4-network-visualization.html#fig:jclu-lnet">2.3</a> visualizations the relationships among disciplines, where again the strength of ties is equal to the number of journals bearing both labels. Here the label with highest number of ties within its cluster becomes the category name of the cluster. That label is then omitted as a node and is instead visualized as a color coding of its cluster, reflecting the special status of the superdiscipline labels.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional graph visualizations that are designed to be pleasing to the eye, this one is drawn according to a statistical model called a latent position or latent space model. It starts with a simple idea that the weight of the edges (the number of journals carrying both labels) is a count that follows a Poisson distribution. This distribution may be modeled by log-linear regression where the logarithm of the mean of the distribution is a linear function of an intercept term and covariates. What is interesting about the model is that the covariate of interest is treated as the distance between the nodes in an unobserved or latent space. The distance is treated as negative such that as nodes get closer together (as the negative distance increases) the count of the edge weight between them increases (technically the logarithm of the mean of the count increases).</p>
<p>It is an elegant idea, but estimating the model is complicated. The distances are metaphorical, and to realize them requires positing a euclidean space in which each node has coordinates. From the coordinates the distances can be easily calculated, but knowing which are the right coordinates requires a complicated estimation routine based on optimizing goodness of fit between guesses of the coordinates and the actual count data. The estimator begins with coordinates taken from the conventional Fruchterman Reingold layout algorithm and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to converge toward the positions that optimally fit the latent space assumption <span class="citation">(See Krivitsky and Handcock <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Krivitsky2008Fitting" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a> for details of the model, estimation, and software)</span>. Even if the estimator does not arrive at a perfect solution it improves upon a conventional layout in the direction of meaningful, and not just pretty, aesthetics thereby helping the viewer to avoid artifacts and perceive real information about the network.</p>
<p>Another great feature of the latent space model is that it allows additional terms to be fit alongside the latent distances. It is possible to control for or net out the effect of nuisance terms like any other regression. As discussed above there is a concern about the undue effect of popular labels. I have already tried to remove the superdiscipline labels from the label network, preferring to represent them as color coded categories rather than nodes. Popular labels may still remain, however, and due to the exponential growth of ties during downmode conversion even a handful of them will have a disproportionate influence on the global layout of the graph.</p>
<p>This degree distortion can be controlled for by what is called a sociality term, which can be thought of as a measure of a node’s popularity. A sociality term is a score for every node that if positive means a node is more attractive and if negative means a node is actually repulsive of ties. When viewing the positions of a latent space model also fit with a sociality term, the space will measure relatedness without the effects of popularity.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="2-4-network-visualization.html#fig:jclu-lnet">2.3</a> plots the results of a latent space model on the label facet omitting superdiscipline nodes. Figure <a href="2-4-network-visualization.html#fig:layouts">2.4</a> plots the same in an animation comparing the latent space and traditional Fruchterman Reingold layouts. I will interpret the substance of the latent space layout below, but first I will comment briefly on some of the differences between it and the traditional layout.</p>

Figure 2.4: Fruchterman Reingold and latent space layouts compared
</p>
</div>
<p>In the animation nodes are hollow shapes to make their overlaps more obvious. The size and shape of the nodes relates to their fitted sociality: circles indicate attractive and diamonds repulsive nodes, and the the larger the shape the more attractive and the smaller the more repulsive. The layouts differ in two important respects. First the global patterns are dissimilar. The latent graph has four discernible arms. The traditional graph is a cloud that at first glance seems evenly dispersed, however there is a prominent core periphery pattern, with circles concentrated in the center and diamonds displaced in a ring around them. Second, patterns of node proximity are distinct. In the latent graph, nodes may share or almost share a center, indicating structural equivalence. In the traditional layout concentric node positions are algorithmically prohibited by a repulsion radius, with apparent overlaps due only to the scaling of node size. The traditional core periphery pattern is the consequence of the imbalance between low and high degree nodes; by netting it out with the sociality term the latent model makes it possible for minor disciplines to cluster around the major ones to which they are anchored.</p>
