<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Genre</h2>
<p>I take genre as a candidate explicans for the ability of scholars to know what to read and what to avoid from the cultural archive. A theory of genre will benefit from a review of the literature, yet to do so would catch me in the conundrum of performing the phenomenon I wish to explain. The genre structure of sociology should guide me to a definition of genre, a statement that already presumes an ontological difference and morphological relation between disciplines and genres, namely that scholarly genres are not equivalent to scholarly disciplines and that the former are located within the later. I will begin with an unstudied attempt to tease out the relation of discipline and genre before turning to a more rigorous, even empirical, treatment of genre as a term in American scholarship.</p>
<p>Genre is a loanword from French. The origin of the French-Latin word “genre” and the English-German word “kind” both mean membership by inheritance of innate class characteristics, archaically by presumptive blood descent within a family, race, or nation. In common English it is restricted to mean a broad category of art, especially literature and music, and some but not all other cultural fields (e.g. baseball is not a genre of sports). As a term in scholarship, genre may be an observable phenomenon, a conceptual component of a theory, or a conflation of the two. In the social sciences genre is a specialty concept as in sociology, while in the humanities it is ubiquitous especially in cultural studies. Academics define and use the term differently between and within disciplines.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="3-1-genre.html#fig:ttsgnr">3.1</a> shows the count of mentions of the term genre in the Google Books Ngram database for English terms <span class="citation">(Michel et al. <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Michel2011Quantitative" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. The trend exhibits the typical take-off in publishing in the second half of the twentieth century. I apply change point analysis, which detects significant differences in time series data <span class="citation">(James and Matteson <a href="bibliography.html#ref-James2019ecp" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Matteson and James <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Matteson2013Nonparametric" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, to the second difference of the trend, a measure of acceleration, to get clues as to whether the trend is a single process or whether there are inflection points. The first segment of the curve from 1899 to 1984 indicates a period of positive acceleration or quickening of the growth trend. On average in the first period the rate of change from one year to the next increased by a modest 13.3 occurrences a year. However, during the period from 1985 to 2008 the rate of change, though always steep, began to decline by an average of 238.3 occurrences a year. Like a projectile that is simultaneously climbing and falling, 1984 acts as launch point of precipitous yet unsustainable growth.</p>

Figure 3.1: Absolute count of term “genre”, 1901-2008.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="3-1-genre.html#fig:ttsgnr2">3.2</a> shows a similar trend but using relative frequencies instead of absolute counts. Here “genre” is plotted as its share of all terms in the corpus. This trend exhibits no inflection point at 1984 that is statistically significant, and visually the trend does appear the same on both sides. No other inflections points are detectable due likely to greater year over year variability in this series in the first half of the century, reducing confidence in any estimate of a change point. To interpret this difference in statistical significance between relative and absolute measures would indicate that interest in genre continued to grow even within a secular slow-down in the volume of texts that resembles the familiar S-shaped diffusion curve. Alternatively, on visual inspection of the relative curve it appears that indeed there is an inflection point, just one a decade later in 1996. After this point the relative frequency seems to drop rapidly, a change that would no doubt be picked up statistically after a few more years of data and one that may in fact be located a few years earlier than the peak suggests. Together these trends describe a career to the term genre that has been strong for a century and that may now be in decline.</p>

Figure 3.2: Relative frequency of term “genre”, 1901-2008.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="3-1-genre.html#fig:genre-goog">3.3</a> gives an indication of what things the term genre has been used to describe. It illustrates the frequency of terms appearing in the Google Books Ngram corpus as the third term in the trigrams beginning with “genre of” or “genres of” <span class="citation">(Google <a href="bibliography.html#ref-2012Google" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. The size of the words is proportional to the total frequency of the trigram in the English corpus, which spans centuries from 1590 to 2008. The bias of the source–books–is clear in the outsized importance of “literature” and “writing” which are followed closely by “music”. The next ten largest nouns are poetry, discourse, fiction, art, autobiography, painting, film, romance, folklore, and history. Ranked within that series would be several adjectives as well: popular, science (fiction), historical, and literary. Each of these terms refers to a field of concrete cultural products, with the exception of “discourse” which is more abstract.</p>
