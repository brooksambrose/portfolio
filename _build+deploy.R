# DEPLOY
# Always after building, run the deploy line to copy .html from the preview
# folder to the deployment folder (/home/rstudio/docs/), commit all changes, add
# a robots.txt, and prepare for manual push to origin. Even after running the
# script your site will NOT be deployed until you push.
