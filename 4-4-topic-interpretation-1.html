<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> <!--M2--> Topic interpretation</h2>
<p>We fit a structural topic model with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> equal to 50 and with one document covariate term, whether the document was from anthropology or sociology. While not strictly necessary, the discipline term provides a convenient method of ranking the topics according to the discipline in which they are most prevalent. Figure <a href="4-4-topic-interpretation-1.html#fig:kts">4.14</a> shows all 50 topics as a time series by discipline, ranked from the most prevalent in anthropology to the most prevalent in sociology. Toward the middle of the grid are topics that are more equally divided between the disciplines. We will first characterize the most anthropological and most sociological topics and then discuss a few that are mixed, and in the next section we will analyze whether there are turning points that correspond to the exogenous events we have described above.</p>
<p>Mathematically, a topic is a pair of probability vectors, one describing the topic as a composition of terms, and the other describing documents as a composition of topics. Researchers conventionally use these probabilities to create ranked word and document lists that then stand in for the qualitative content modeled by the topics. An inspection of the underlying documents is beyond the present scope, but it would entail dividing the corpus into clusters based on the main topic classifications of each document and possibly by different patterns of topic mixing. Instead we understand documents in their disaggregated forms, with the portion they contribute to a topic being added to that of every other document participating in the same vocabulary.</p>
<p>Although vocabulary is an abstract concept it nonetheless represents an independent dimension of scholarship. Vocabularies are ways that scholars can connect to common conversations. They exist above and between particular documents, and in many ways vocabularies are a signal of relevance. The mass of a vocabulary can be thought of as the aggregate number of words drawn from it across the entire professional field. We assume perfect information and access to all scholarship, which at this point in history is not an unrealistic standard given that we have limited the study to the single most important journal in each discipline. This means that the average scholar was aware of most of the different conversations occurring within their own field of study, an assumption that in the present day would be untenable given the subsequent growth of the social sciences. By measuring the number of words drawn from each vocabulary we have a macroscopic view of how the attention of the entirety of each discipline was allocated and when.</p>
<p>Below we will characterize selected topics both by the pattern of their time series and by the words most important within each topic. There are two approaches to measuring a term’s importance within a topic. The first is its raw frequency, which is its local topic probability multiplied by its global corpus frequency. These are the words that appear the most often within a topic. Second is a topic’s relative share of a term’s frequency, which means that a term is important to the extent that it is exclusively concentrated within a topic. In the tables that follow we provide a term list of each type, as well as a third list which is an equal weighting of both criteria. The formula we use to construct these lists is called relevancy, and it is controlled by a weighting parameter lambda that sets the ratio of frequency to exclusivity <span class="citation">(Sievert and Shirley <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Sievert2014LDAvis" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. When lambda is close to 0 the ranking reflects exclusivity, when it is close to 1 it reflects frequency, and when it is 0.5 it is an equal weighting. It is possible for a word to be both frequent and exclusive, and this may appropriately be considered evidence of even greater importance to a topic. Indeed as a single label to refer to topics that is more memorable than a number, we will use the most highly ranked term when frequency and exclusivity are ranked equally.</p>

<p>From this population of time series we select several illustrative cases. First we compare topics that align strongly with one discipline or the other to those that are mixed. Then we compare topics according to their trajectories ahead of and during WWI.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Anthropology</h3>
<p>Topic 29, <em>feet</em>, is the largest for anthropology and encompasses the archaeology of native American civilizations. It includes research into the famous mound builders of the Adena cultures, but covers all discourse surrounding excavation. It may rightly be called the archaeological discourse within anthropology. The topic trend is consistently high over the sample period with a peak around 1907.</p>

<p>Topic 28, <em>Museum</em>, shows a more variable pattern. It is relatively week until just before the turn of the century where it experiences a surge. Also relevant to archaeology, and even more explicitly so, the topic covers the names of important figures like Smithsonian. <em>Museum</em> may be the archival facet of the same endeavor that <em>feet</em> represents in the field. The rise in the trend is mirrored by a similar decline in the second half of the period, which is consistent with expected decline of the term ethnology which is very frequent.</p>

<p>Topic 31, <em>Totemism</em>, shows a different pattern, rising only slowly at first then gaining speed toward the end of the period and through the war. It represents a concern with the culture and politics of lineage in tribal social structure. The model anchor phratry is a technical term for kinship groups, and exogamy refers to marriage between groups.</p>

<p>Topic 34, <em>instincts</em>, is an example of a trend continuously on the rise in this period. It is also exemplary for sociology’s preference for abstract theorizing, which stood in stark contrast to anthropology’s deep embedding in empirical field studies. The terms are relevant to psycho-social discourse around human drives and experiences of sociality and selfhood.</p>

<p>Few series from sociology exhibit a decreasing trend, but topic 30, <em>church</em>, is chief among them. It is a very important topic at the beginning of the period then declines rapidly to a low point around 1905 after which it meanders along never recovering its former significance. The concern with religion appears to be narrowly Christian, and it is unclear whether the discourse is about religion or is itself a <em>religious discourse</em>. If the latter then its decline may make more sense as sociology was founded on secular principals.</p>

<p>Most of the topics that contain a mixture of sociology and anthropology are small in frequency, though there are few exceptions that are larger. A significant one is topic 32, <em>literary</em>, which reflects professional engagement with humanistic fields like English or it may be conversations on the journalism of the day. Apart from a spike in sociology around 1905 the two disciplines participate evenly in this discourse.</p>

<p>Another smaller mixture is topic 26, <em>regular</em>, which likely refers to professional communications and news around conferences. It is interesting that there is rarely a substantive overlap between disciplines, but that they mirror each other in their metadiscourse around the profession itself. It may be the case that the disciplines looked to each other to replicate patterns of professional association.</p>

<div id="better-worse-or-stayed-the-same" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Better, worse, or stayed the same</h3>
<p>While the examples above provide some cursory insights into a few of the notable topics, our goals here are not primarily qualitative. We aim to observe how fields waxed and waned in response to larger events in American society, namely the onset and duration of WWI. When inspecting individual time series it is easy to see associations with particular events that may in fact be coincidences, chance occurrences, or trends that are better explained by different happenings. If, however, multiple times series appear to shift at similar times, it is stronger evidence that the momentous event is the one that matters most.</p>
<p>In this section we take an inductive approach to answering this question. The change point analysis already applied above is well suited to this task. Whereas before we looked for turning points in singular times series, now we may look at all 100 trends simultaneously, one each for sociology and anthropology in each topic. The change point algorithm iteratively explores each annual transition to see whether the mean of the trend is statistically different on either side, and it returns change points only if they pass a threshold of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Here we set the threshold to a significance level of .99 and feed each topic time series to the change point algorithm, truncating the period of AA that predates the start of AJS to make the disciplines comparable, for a final range of 1895 to 1922. Additionally we may specify the minimum distance between detected points, the smallest interval being two years. We choose this interval to allow the solution to be as granular as the data suggest. Nevertheless this procedure yielded only two significant change points, one in 1902 and one in 1912. The earlier of these is plausibly close to the end of the sowing period of rapid institutional growth, while the second falls only two years before the onset of war.</p>
<p>We take these findings of two change points as some support or our central argument that the historical context matters. What remains to be seen is how the history mattered. To address this question for the onset of war we classify the trends into categories of the direction of change before and after the change point. The possibilities were that a trend could slow down, speed up, or stay the same. To model these effects we apply a robust regression using a spline term with knots set to our change points. This model produces a linear effect in the periods between the change points that is also constrained to intersect at the knots such that the predicted trend is continuous.</p>
<p>Table <a href="4-4-topic-interpretation-1.html#tab:chnsum">4.13</a> reports the distribution of the two disciplines according to these three possibilities. In the right margin it can be observed that the majority times series exhibited no change in trend. Some of this effect is owed to the large number of series that are essentially off for one or the other discipline, hence a flat trend near zero for the entire period. The negative and positive numbers are more revealing. In the aggregate there are more than twice as many negative changes as there are positive changes. This is consistent with the expectation that war would have a depressive effect on organizational output especially where that organization, social science scholarship, is not understood to be immediately relevant to the war effort. Simply, attention shifted elsewhere.</p>
<p>Within disciplines there are considerable differences. The AA series were more likely to stay on an even trajectory, whereas the AJS series were more likely to experience especially negative change. It should be noted here that what we are measuring is the change in the slope of the line before and after 1912. A series that is already sloping downward will be classed as a positive change if the decline abates to a shallower trend, even if the trend is still down. Any trend that stays on its former path, whether increasing or decreasing, will be classed as not changing.</p>

<p>A large trend that experiences a measurable decline for AJS is topic 12, <em>book</em>. It appears to be the contextual words that describe book reviews. If this topic represents a measure of the count of book reviews, a decline may reflect a momentary drop in book publishing or a shift in attention away from books. AA, which also contains book reviews, does not experience a slow down and in fact remains on an upward trend, even seeing a boost during the war.</p>

<p>Topic 17, <em>meet</em>, is a smaller AA series that experiences a nose dive during the war. It seems to refer to terms around conferences and meetings. If this is an indication of real conference activity rather than merely its advertisement, it is surprising to think that there would be a decline in professional association for anthropologists during this time. Sociology turns the other way, increasing its mentions of meetings.</p>

<p>Topic 22, <em>wars</em>, is the largest topic in sociology and seems to coincide closely with WWI, though terms suggesting a concern with civil unrest may predate the concern with militarism. It may reflect a broader interest in social problems relevant to political democracy, including the problems of industrialization and nation building. Its trend was insignificant until 1910 at which point it started a precipitous rise that continued unabated through WWI.</p>

<p>Topic 3, <em>ceremony</em>, is an anthropology trend with an interesting pattern. Though it swings upward during WWI, this is due in part to the decline of an earlier ascent in the sowing period. The topic relates to the ceremony and ritual of Hopi civilization of the American southwest, of which Tusayan and Zufii were two important sites. It is possible that this series represents two generations of scholarship into this work, as its popularity waned soon enough to wax again a decade after its original prominence.</p>

<p>Topic 46, <em>schools</em>, is large and resembles <em>wars</em> in its rapid growth before and during the war. Not merely limited to education, the topic appears to refer to rural sociology, which was organized as a semi-autonomous profession specializing in the social and economic challenges of small towns, and which was often a counterpoint to the emphasis on the study of cities represented by the epicenter of sociology at the University of Chicago, where AJS itself was published.</p>

The term explorer allows you to vary the lambda ratio between frequency and exclusivity to see how the status of particular words changes. It also shows how the topics relate to each other in a two dimensions space of term similarity, which succeeds at reproducing an axis between sociology and anthropology, albeit with other unexplored differences. Perhaps its most useful feature is the ability to easily observe how the frequency of individual words varies across topics, helping to highlight interesting cases of polysemy.</p>

One final case to explore inolves the polysemy, or multiple meanings, of the word ethnology. As we have discussed ethnology was a synonym for anthropology in an earlier era, and anthropologies entrance into the modern university setting coincided in part with a casting away of the ethnology label.
