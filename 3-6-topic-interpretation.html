<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Topic interpretation</h2>
<p>At long last and armored with a diagnostic assessment of the topics, it is appropriate to interpret the model content of topics. We have three exhibits to assist us in topic interpretation. First are journal topic associations. Second are notes taken above during blind QCV of bellwether texts, which usually amount to gut reactions to the front matter of articles. Finally we will inspect the topic by term lists directly. We will initialize each topic interpretation by inspecting journals and bellwethers, and then we will elaborate the content using the model lists, being sure to note instances of polysemy.</p>
<div id="journals" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Journals</h3>
<p>A good place to begin is to ask whether we have done more than merely reproduce a categorical scheme we already had access to. If topics are entirely predicted by journals, then they may not be very valuable as guides to scholarship, though confirming this would be an argument against the importance of interdisciplinarity. Figure <a href="3-6-topic-interpretation.html#fig:jourchi">3.19</a> shows the relationship between topics and journals when documents are assigned to their primary topic classification. Each journal is scored by the standardized <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> residuals from a test of categorical association between a table of topics by journal document counts. The standardized residuals can be interpreted as t-scores on a normal distribution; they represent the distance between observed and predicted table frequencies in standard errors from what would be expected if the dimensions were independent. Roughly, scores with a standardized residual higher than two are worth noting, and the higher the residual the stronger the association. Rather than sort through all 874 discrete journals for each topic, I report only the top ten highest residuals.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Bellwether texts</h3>
<p>Recall that the inspection of bellwethers occurred in the context of a shuffled list coming from two topics. Notes were taken to record the rationale that was the basis for splitting the texts into two groups. Over the course of the 45 separate tasks, themselves shuffled randomly, the rationales for each topic set in and the sorting task became easier. Below we characterize each topic based on an inspection of the journals with which they are associated and the blind QCV notes.</p>

</div>
<p>The topic by term matrix is unwieldy; Figure <a href="3-6-topic-interpretation.html#fig:genr-mod-viz">3.20</a> provides a browser generated by the <code>LDAvis</code> package that helps display topic associations and term lists. In the left panel a multidimensional scaling technique is used to reduce the term vector two two dimensions. The area of topic bubbles is proportional to the topic’s share of total corpus frequency, and shorter distances between topics indicate similarity in term content. In the right panel terms are displayed as bars with their topic frequency (red) as a share of their corpus frequency (blue). This list may be sorted by several scoring techniques that operationalize the notion of exclusivity in different ways.</p>
<p>First, when no topics are selected, the list is sorted by a score called saliency. Saliency is a measure of how informative a word is for guessing the topic from which it comes. Terms that are both very frequent and very exclusive rise to the top of this list, and indeed the most salient term “film” is very frequent and is an anchor term for topic 5. Recall that anchor terms are found in one and no other topics. It is rare to be frequent and an anchor; it is more common that terms are frequent but salient by virtue of being totally absent from some if not all other topics. For example, the term “text” is common and found in almost every topic, but is totally absent from topics 5 (film) and 6 (music), which makes sense if text, film, and music are simply different terms for what is a singular object orientation of each topic. The few true anchor terms on this list are film (5), les (8), chinese (3), sexual (7), and cinema (5 again!). Anchor terms for the remaining topics are too infrequent to show up as globally salient, but they include literacy (1), biblical (2), utopia (4), musicians (6), hamlet (9), and painter (10).</p>
<p>Second, when a topic is selected its terms can be ranked by a score called relevance <span class="citation">(Sievert and Shirley <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Sievert2014LDAvis" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>:66)</span>. Relevance is a balanced sum of the overall frequency of a term and its lift, which is its topic frequency as a proportion of its corpus frequency. The weighting parameter lambda (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) sets the balance of the sum. When lambda is one terms are sorted in the classic order of their topic probability. When lambda is zero terms are sorted by their exclusivity to the topic regardless of how infrequent they are (practically, a setting just above zero allows anchor terms, which all have equal rank and a topic proportion of one, to be sorted by their frequency). Setting lambda to zero will put all anchor terms at the top, and empirically it turns out the anchor list is often quite long. Practically, setting lambda to 0.5 tends to nominate a handful of terms important to the focal topic as well as others, highlighting cases of polysemy, ambiguity, or true pantopical relevance.</p>
<p>Recall that goodness of fit during estimation makes reference only to a topic’s ability to explain global corpus frequencies. While relevance and salience are interesting postestimation techniques, estimation was not designed to form topics that maximize them. Nonetheless, to the extent that anchor words are highly relevant, the use of anchor words to initialize estimation does allow these particularly relevant terms to impact model results. Though we did not describe the model method of choosing anchor terms, the ultimate choice remains apparent in the final model as an artifact. Anchor terms are identifiable as the only terms for which the fitted log of the probability is -1000, the arbitrary minimum, for the nine topics for which the term is <em>not</em> the anchor.</p>

<div id="dossiers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4</span> Dossiers</h3>
<p>Below we assemble the several source of topic interpretation to create a dossier on each topic, and finally establish for each a theory of topic meaning. Recall that until this point we have been reticent to describe such theories for fear of the confirmation bias they will exert on close readings of texts. These biases are inevitable and the goal is to exert some control over their formation rather than to presume we may approach texts from an unbiased vantage point. Thus we expect that in the writing of dossiers we will at this stage solidify the confirmation bias that will inform the subsequent “close, but” readings of texts. We table the problem of seriation and proceed in numerical order to aid in later referencing. Each dossier was written by first completing the initial characterization from journals, then layering on bellwether considerations, and finally by inspecting topic term list. For concision we present all of the results for each topic in one paragraph.</p>
<div id="topic-1-students" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.1</span> Topic 1, <em>students</em></h4>
<p>Topic 1 refers to what I above called the “abstract” sense of genres of discourse. The leading journals are different; the first <em>Discourse Studies</em> is general while the second <em>Research in the Teaching of English</em> seems to apply the notion of discourse to the particular professional domains of education and literacy. During QCV the importance of discourse was never noticed, and it was almost entirely taken to be about teaching and pedagogy especially with respect to writing. A few articles dealt with technical writing in business rather than in education contexts. From the term lists the model anchor “remake” is not expected, and in fact we might have expected it to occur in topic 5. The bulk of the terms are related to education. Not only “discourse” but “writing”, “reading”, and “text” share considerable overlap with other topics, and may help place topic 1 in a central location on the topic map.</p>

<div id="topic-2-god" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.2</span> Topic 2, <em>god</em></h4>
<p>Topic 2, which above we interpreted as religious studies, is here led by the journal <em>Quaderni di Studi Arabi</em>, which is dedicated to the culture and history of Arab civilization. While that scope may include religion we would expect it to extend far beyond it. While there are certainly more explicitly religious journals among the list, there are also journals dedicated to antiquity. This helps broaden our understanding of the topic, which is more about the history of Abrahamic civilization than about religion narrowly. We should also resist a western centric notion of religion, as we are bound to discover important religious themes in topic 3. During QCV this was often labeled as “biblical” with occasional reference to Islam or the Quran or Hellenism. Indeed the most relevant term “ibn” means “son of” in Arabic names. The model anchor “Twain” seems fairly oblique to the topic although Mark Twain may have spoke frequently of god. The term lists remind us that underlying biases in publishing, here the over representation of Christian topics, can be reproduced with a naive focus on high frequency terms.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.3</span> Topic 3, <em>chinese</em></h4>
<p>Topic 3 includes several pan Asian studies journals as well as journals focusing on Japan and China. Like topic 8 the signal in likely due to language and cultural content and perhaps more simply geographical terminology like state names. Unlike topic 8 they were not drawn into the sample because of a coincidental meanings of “genre” in French. During QCV a specifically historical thrust was apparent especially with reference to Chinese imperial dynasties. Interestingly Hittite civilization appeared more than once, which is geographically closer to the content of topic 2 but nonetheless categorized separately. Several references were made to the Song dynasty, which poses a true polysemy and disambiguation challenge with respect to topic 6.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The terms contain many more proper nouns, place and person names, than other topics, and raise the importance of Japanese and Korean topics that were not as apparent in the bellwethers.</p>

<div id="topic-4-fiction" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.4</span> Topic 4, <em>fiction</em></h4>
<p>Topic 4 is almost exclusively concentrated in the journal <em>Science Fiction Studies</em>, with a smattering of weaker associations across a diverse set of journals. This suggests a fairly narrow focus, not even of fiction but a subgenre of it. During QCV the topic was difficult to disentangle, though ultimately it was not confused with any other topic. It was often noted to be fiction or science fiction, but as often it included the analysis of cultures of utopianism or futurism, often applied in nonfiction settings, for instance, to study historical narratives in support of political racism and in various locations like the American west, the USSR, and post colonial Africa. Inspecting the term lists seems to efface the prominence of science fiction in favor of a political and historical terminology, though the model choice of Asimov for an anchor is a helpful reminder of the journal origin of the topic. The mixing of fiction and nonfiction topics may be a symptom of poor fit, or there may be a real elective affinity intersecting on utopianism.</p>

<div id="topic-5-film" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.5</span> Topic 5, <em>film</em></h4>
<p>Topic 5 is very well represented among a variety of journals dedicated to film and cinema. We wonder if the quantity of journals is reflective of industry support. Mixed with film articles were several related to television and one related to video games, perhaps sharing terms in common to the description of U.S. industrial entertainment media. The horror genre appeared to be over represented. We may speculate that subtopics with more exclusive vocabulary, even if they are a minority of cases, may come to be more representative of a topic than one would expect. Indeed the term lists reveal “Dracula” to be the model anchor and “zombie” and “horror” to be highly relevant, whereas “noir” is the only other subgenre term showing up in the top ten lists. While it is possible that horror is actually over represented in film scholarship, the model behavior suggests that it merely has a more distinctive vocabulary. Topic 5 was confused once with 7, perhaps due to the importance of storytelling to each.</p>

<p>Topic 6 has several strong journals led by <em>Popular Music</em>, and interestingly <em>Asian Theatre Journal</em>. Farther down the list are discipline specific journals. The music topic was obvious and noted to be sorted with particular ease during QCV but was actually confused once with topic 2. The model anchor “jin” is probably a reference to the Jin dynasty in China, which indicates a curious segregation of the historical relevance of music in a presumably theater context from the rest of topic 3, where the model assumes that the term Jin is <em>never</em> discussed. Similarly, it is telling that the term “Indonesian” can be understood by its placement as an exclusive term in a music category to never be relevant to another topic. We might expect historical geographies to be relevant in all of their cultural dimensions, but at least with reference to the term genre there is considerable topic segregation.</p>

<div id="topic-7-women" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.7</span> Topic 7, <em>women</em></h4>
<p>Topic 7, like 4, is concentrated in one journal, <em>Marvels and Tales</em> which is about folklore, yet the second journal <em>Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality</em> could not seem more different. Two other journals relate to women’s studies, and several other journals relate specifically to British folklore. During QCV this topic was misunderstood as two different topics, one about folklore and one about gender and sexuality often with reference to youth and family. This may help explain why topic 7 was confused twice, once with 5 and once with 10. It is possible that the importance of family and gender in folk tales, for instance Arthurian tales of chivalry, allows folklore to be merged with modern gender studies. The model anchor “Archie” likely relates to problematic gender assumptions in the comic book series. The term lists otherwise describe a topic that is unequivocally about gender and sexuality, with queer topics showing up as highly relevant. Only one hint of folklore, Gawain, is observable in the top ten lists. Farther down the list especially at lambda = 0.5 are terms specific to family relationships, “husband” for instance being an anchor word.</p>

<div id="topic-8-les" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.8</span> Topic 8, <em>les</em></h4>
<p>Topic 8 is seemingly related to French and music studies but is led by the biology journal <em>Crustaceana</em> and includes <em>Botanical Review</em>. This collection is likely united by the appearance of many French language terms, caught in the initial sample definition of the common French term “genre”, which after all is a French loanword translating to “kind” but in the native tongue referring to much more than culture. Indeed genre also has the more special meaning “genus” which explains the appearance of life science journals. These errors should be removed from the sample but they provide an instructive challenge, or perhaps an easy win, for the topic model estimator. Unfortunately removing texts by the topic score may actually eliminate substantive texts that happen to deal with French language content but are relevant to genre studies, so removal by journal is more appropriate. During QCV several articles related to orchestral music, one of which was in Italian not French, and Gregorian chants appeared. It was noted that English language articles had the term genre included in a French translation of their abstracts, an in this case nuisance feature of the JSTOR search not disabled by a specific filtering by language. The term list is populated with not only French but also Spanish and Italian stopwords. Topic 8 is so different that it forms its own axis in the scaled topic map.</p>

<div id="topic-9-genre" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.9</span> Topic 9, <em>genre</em></h4>
<p>Topic 9 has one leading journal (<em>New Literary History</em>) like 7 and 4, but there is a clear “language and literature” trend among even the more weakly associated journals. It is interesting that the second journal <em>L’Esprit Créateur</em> is a French language journal; we may anticipate some overlap with the French language topic 8 that may suppress its prominence here. Also our limited glimpse at topic 2 to illustrate topic descent above revealed the importance of poetry, and topic 9 includes <em>Victorian Poetry</em>. If the term poem is indeed important to topic 9, then it is a caveat against interpreting a term important across multiple topics as exhibiting polysemy, since here it would clearly have the same meaning just in different substantive contexts. During QCV it was sometimes hard to sort, and sometimes treated as separate literary theory and philosophy topics. It is possible that elements of style, such as a stilted or abstract diction, cause these areas to merge. Indeed the likely derogatory model anchor “simplified” may reveal that high minded bickering is characteristic of style more than content! As with topic 7, the error of positing two topics to describe one leads to a higher confusion rate with other topics. More than any other topic the relevant terms are the names of important figures usually real and sometimes imagined. The frequent terms suggest literature, and the relevant terms suggest philosophy. Either the two fields are erroneously merged or literary theory merely draws heavily on philosophy.</p>

<div id="topic-10-painting" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.10</span> Topic 10, <em>painting</em></h4>
<p>Topic 10 is distributed among several journals about art, including a couple of Renaissance studies journals. During QCV this was easy to separate and was labeled painting, as in “Dutch genre painting”. Topic 10 was confused twice, once with 7 and once with 9. The term lists suggest painting but also book publishing and place names specific to the British isles, whereas bellwethers much more strongly evoked Belgium and the Netherlands. The confusion stems from the reader seeing two topics, the British novel on one hand and painting on the other, where in the model they are collapsed, perhaps due to the prominence of London in both art dealing and book publishing.</p>
