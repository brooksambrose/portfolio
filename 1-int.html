<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>As scholarly fields of cultural production grow their discourses tend to undergo a phase transition where hot global tele-communication breaks down into cool parochial epicentrism. I describe three structures–archives, profession, and education–whose relationships explain the social and cultural forces leading to the opening up and closing off of scholarly discourses. Given an archival context, where expansive media collections give unlimited scope to potential conversation topics, education tends to heat to a boil and profession tends to cool to a condensation of discourses. When such discursive tendencies (genres) are embedded in universities (disciplines) the attendant competition over resources pits professionals against educators and makes it possible to arrest cultural dynamism into relatively static historical configurations. <!--Such a social domestication of cultural wildness allows knowledge to be harnessed for economic purposes, namely workforce development (teaching) and product design (research), and sometimes for political ends. These heteronomous interests in predictable output from universities depresses their cultural generativity.--> Such macroscopic historical tendencies are difficult for the local agents of their development to recognize; their myopic experience in university arenas is that of status conflicts around investments in academic genres and fiscal conflicts around investments in disciplinary personnel. Using the focal question scholars new and old must answer–“What to read?”–I posit the genre-like qualities of scholarly discourses and suggest the cognitive, institutional, and social, that is disciplinary, consequences of adhering to or abrogating genre conventions.</p>

<p>The question of what to read is simple to be sure, but in fields of scholarly consumption and production it is nonetheless fundamental. Scholarship is a creative profession where a stock of cultural knowledge forms a greater part of the infrastructure of production than in other fields. This is not to say that other occupations, especially manual ones, lack creativity. It is to say that in such fields knowledge has a limited infrastructure. Whereas the know-how of the brick layer is black boxed in her tools and technology and in the human capital she develops by experience and tacit social learning, for the scholar as bricoleur there exists in addition the distinctively overdeveloped feature of cultural archiving as a universal memory. Except perhaps in outstanding feats of primary research, contributions to scholarship are legitimate to the extent that they have used the archive correctly. This problem of using the archive, by which I mean all libraries and other organizations that help scholars find published work, is easily expressed by the question, “what to read?” Paradoxically, the over-development of the archive induces a functional imperative: to the extent that more and more of scholarship is memorable, mechanisms must develop to forget large swaths of intellectual history. A person who studied a random draw from the archive, even a monumental one, would no doubt qualify as an educated person. Professionally, however, they would have answered the question in a tragically wrong way. From the perspective of other scholars, there are right and wrong choices about what to read. Because it is so easy to access scholarly memory, the operative question really becomes “what not to read?”</p>
<p>Most occupations are not saddled with a heavy burden of memory, remembering in the fashion of a Markov chain only the most recent chapter in their history. Rather than in archives, memory is codified in tools and technology. Though Internet search and self-publishing services, especially video and image based ones, are creating archive-like infrastructure for even manual occupations, the functions are different. Contemporary Internet repositories provide knowledge as factors of production to anyone who queries them, but many do not purport to be archives in the sense that a historical record of cultural products is preserved for posterity. They are much more concerned with access to contemporaneous than to historical material, and indeed the particular configuration of the contemporary that sells the most advertisements ahead of search results. True historical archives of the Internet, such as the Internet Archive or Common Crawl, are not used by the public. Indeed why would they be; they expose the dizzying complexity of the history of the Internet, which, even in only its contemporaneous facet is already overwhelming. The Internet searcher tends to be satisficing, and the search companies have refined their ranking of results to meet their users’ search budgets efficiently.</p>
<p>Searching and finding are different procedures; to search is to turn over every rock, whereas to find is to turn over only the correct rock. The searcher encounters many tricks before alighting on a treat, and must make an effort to reject the false positives. The finder exploits indexing technology that allows her to bypass the wrong material altogether. Without a normative compulsion to make history accessible, Internet search engines, which are actually find engines, avoid the scholarly paradox of memory, which is that in the university system great pains are made to remember everything just so that the correct material may be forgotten. Scholars do not yet have find engines that protect them from encountering irrelevant material, and it is a professional competency to be able to quickly separate wheat from chaff.</p>
<p>Whether the growth of the Internet will bring the wider world into the kinds of relationships with knowledge that have been developing for centuries in universities, or whether the Internet will be something entirely new, is not the task of this paper. Instead I speculate about how the fundamental problem of approaching an archive of ever-growing complexity is solved in ways that have surprising results for those whose careers depend on accessing it. I explore three different roles within institutions of higher education oriented to the archive and to each other: the archivist, the professor, and the educator. Along the way I will explore how the knowledge in the archive is used for purposes other than scholarship and education.</p>
</div>
<div id="knowledge-roles" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.0.1</span> Knowledge roles</h3>
<p>I begin by outlining three roles within universities in an abstract way, that is, by drawing out their motivations and orientations toward knowledge as well as how those orientations condition the way that each relates to the others. While I will attempt to describe each role’s myopic attitude to knowledge, which informs their daily work, I will also discuss the ways that their behavior sorts knowledge into patterns that then have effects on the knowledge environment of each other role.</p>
<p>The first of three knowledge roles is that of the archivist. The archivist is a knowledge distributor and orients to knowledge in an indexing capacity. Their role is to understand a lot of knowledge quickly and help match clients with knowledge problems to cultural objects in the archive that may provide knowledge solutions. The archivist’s interest in knowledge at scale creates a cognitive need for knowledge classification systems that work for a variety of clients, namely scholars, educators, students, and the public. The archivist is formally in a support role that is universalistic and bureaucratized, hence she operates as staff for other roles so long as they are following the rules. Informally, the archivist is wedded to the archive itself and may wish to educate people about its contents. After all, the archivist has especially broad knowledge to share beyond merely responding to client requests. She therefore may attempt to influence how other roles orient to knowledge from her own vantage point.</p>
<p>The second role is that of the professor. To profess is to “declare publicly”. Because knowledge is a part of the status and the authority of the professor, they have an interest in maintaining its relative value against the people to which they profess, to their audience. The professor does not want to be supplanted by her interlocutor. She wishes to gather resources toward her, including audiences, and to maintain the attention of benefactors <span class="citation">(Gould <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Gould2002Origins" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>. These resources are felt to be necessary for the economic work of scholarly production, or they are important to personal identity. The professor faces a moral hazard toward crypticism, and may not go out of her way to let the foundations of her knowledge transfer to her clients. She has a particular knowledge format that is a lean message of information that does not give away the farm. This is usually what her clients want.</p>
<p>The third role is that of the educator. Compared to the professor, the educator attempts to stand in a lateral rather than in a superior social relation to others. Whereas the professor attracts people toward her, the educator attempts to move with people often in a direction of their choosing. She maximizes knowledge transfer and seeks to obviate her role with a particular person, though her role also requires fresh inputs of ignorant laity. The educator always stands in a superior knowledge position; even if followers reach the point where the leader was, the leader may always be further ahead. Yet socially she attempts to project radically egalitarian, which is to say reciprocal, authority. The moral hazard of the educator is quixotism; the professor is much more savvy about how to create security and status out of knowledge and has a conservative orientation. The educator empowers the ignorant to choose where to invest their labor, and this may lead to tilting at windmills.</p>
<p>By professor, or professing person, I do not necessarily mean the job title in a university. To be a professor is to have a particular way of relating to knowledge and of using knowledge in relation to other people. Anyone can be a professor if they know something valuable; it is how they mobilize that knowledge in social interaction that makes them a professor. The same can be said, mutatis mutandis, for the other roles as well. Anyone who helps others index and locate knowledge is an archivist. Anyone who helps others reproduce knowledge is an educator. Because these are functions as well as job titles, anyone in a formal role may do each of these functions in a day, and what they do about knowledge will be a consequence both of the formal responsibilities of their title as well as the personal commitments they bring to their occupation.</p>
<p>These three role relationships are oriented not primarily to each other role. They are each constituted out of an asymmetry of knowledge and each role is a knowledge specialist. Instead they orient to people who know less than they do. In these roles the occupant accumulates knowledge in the course of their work, and their valued contribution involves the exchange of this knowledge for status and resources. What differs between the professor and the educator is how the knowledge asymmetry is exploited to maintain either hierarchical social authority (profession) or reciprocal authority (education) <span class="citation">(Gould <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Gould1999Race" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>; Parsons and Platt <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Parsons1970Age" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, authority is the ability to transfer one’s own goals to other people, that is, to induce them to act in a way that achieves your own priorities. In hierarchical authority such goal transfer usually goes from the superior to the inferior position. In reciprocal authority each party may at times lead and at times follow. Professorial authority serves to maintain a knowledge asymmetry because goals oriented to knowledge production are firmly in control of the expert. Rather than exchange factors of knowledge production, professors, professionals in general, wish to exchange a knowledge product for a reward, even if that reward is the mere maintenance of former status. In reciprocal authority an educator transacts factors of knowledge production across the boundary of their knowledge asymmetry, serving to erode the boundary over time.</p>
<p>It is again helpful to be reminded that a person with the title of professor may shift between hierarchical and reciprocal relationships. Because the causal axis relates to asymmetries of knowledge, professors may find themselves engaging in reciprocal relationships especially among peers with whom knowledge asymmetries are less pronounced. Regardless of the personal relationships professors seek out, they in fact possess knowledge in such relative abundance that any randomly chosen potential relationship will be asymmetrical, and were they to engage the relationship would be hierarchical.</p>
