<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Knowledge as password</h2>
<p>My objective in describing the above value orientations to knowledge is not to make a moral argument; educational relationships are not more fair or just than professional ones. My concern is to elaborate the consequences for the cultivation of the knowledge environment given the knowledge transfer predilections of the different roles. Knowledge is not organized into one universal system of relevance. If it were, one would merely need to count how much someone knows and observe their value orientation to what they know to predict what kinds of relationships they would form with others. There would be one universal hierarchy with the most learned member sitting at the top.</p>
<p>In fact qualitative distinctions between knowledges make the picture much more complicated. Knowledges are like currencies in local economies; wealth in one market does not guarantee wealth in another market. The multiple centers of knowledge create the complicated system that ensures demand for the role of the archivist, not just to safeguard the historical record, but to transmit and communicate knowledge indices that help all members of the knowledge environment locate themselves. The topology of this multiply epicentric knowledge space is the world within which all knowledge workers live.</p>
<p>What I wish to argue is that it is the behavior of professors in particular that maintains the shape of the knowledge space, that is, that makes it more multiply epicentric and fractured than it might otherwise be if education were historically dominant. Of course professors are not trying to landscape a global knowledge space; they are trying to do their work of knowledge production and of securing the resources necessary to keep doing that work. But in doing this work they are continuing in a long tradition of other professors who have had a systematic interest in maintaining knowledge asymmetry, since this worked to their advantage most of the time. Professors whether they are reflective about it or not occupy knowledge settlements that are adapted to maintaining the boundaries of knowledge that are constitutive of scholarly subfields. By way of example, I will concentrate on one mechanism, the password system, that maintains and exploits these knowledge boundaries. I will then provide an illustration of the global knowledge terrain that passwords and similar mechanisms create.</p>
<p>Though cultural abundance may be cultivated on the universal egalitarian grounds that knowledge be made accessible to all, the complexity of the archive creates an opportunity for the establishment of social hierarchy. Because the archive’s size so wildly outstrips individual and organizational capacities to know its contents, methods of selection become paramount. Indeed the power to control what counts as a legitimate selection becomes a basis for authority and the conferral of status. Status reflects a person’s generalized ability or inability to accrue resources to herself over the claims of others. Social institutions define the conditions of status attainment, and different institutions validate statuses according to different norms, truths, and values. Knowledge as a valued resource mediates social relationships and stabilizes status hierarchies differently in professions than in education. The stability of status hierarchies depends on a qualified segregation of these institutions, as the norms of one can be corrosive to the norms of the other.</p>
<p>In the cynical view of professions, scholarship is the encryption of memory by secret sets. If each field of professional scholarship is a club, their passwords are particular lists of items from the archive. Comers arriving with off-list items or without enough of the correct items may be held at the door, or if they are given entry, will be marked with a scarlet letter. To say that the password items are the only ones relevant to knowledge in the field is incredible; the depth of the archive always impresses even the most experienced divers. The importance of the list is not only in its knowledge potential but also in its exclusionary function. Knowledge of the list is a qualification, ignorance a disqualification for club membership.</p>
<p>Why check qualifications at all? The archive, in rendering knowledge accessible and transparent, obviates a conventional function of professions which is to restrict their ranks by controlling access to secret knowledge. If the knowledge is not secret, a field must find other mechanisms of exclusion to establish itself as a profession. To make matters worse, the university contexts in which scholars work tend to confront them with a public and to impose on them a duty of education or service. Professionals who are embedded in markets trade the products of their capacities, goods and services, for money. Their clients have no serious interest in acquiring the professional’s capacity to produce, and this inscrutable cognitive base <span class="citation">(DiMaggio and Powell <a href="bibliography.html#ref-DiMaggio1983Iron" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>:152)</span> constitutes the client’s experience of the professional’s expertise.</p>
<p>Scholarship is based in the university and not in the market, and here the value orientation to knowledge is very different. Professionals default to entering into client, rather than peer, relationships. The scholar’s “clients”–students, the public, and other scholars–may be as interested in the production as they are in the product. From an intellectual property perspective, “ideas are strongly nonrival (they are not used up) and only weakly excludable (they are difficult to protect from use by others)” <span class="citation">(Thompson <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Thompson1995Conceptions" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>:278)</span>. Because educational commitments promote the free flow of ideas, knowledge qua knowledge cannot be the basis of professional exclusion within an institution designed to diffuse it.</p>
<p>The use of knowledge for the effect of exclusion should not be overstated. If a scholarly field is considered to be a profession within itself, it has an interest in controlling who it lets in and who it keeps out. Thus an exclusion mechanism is always also an inclusion mechanism. To emphasize exclusion is to recognize that this is the more important function given the asymmetries of scale scholarly fields face in the university environment. The scarce resources they have acquired, both in terms of a core of symbolic knowledge and in real employment opportunities, compared to the sheer size of social and cultural solicitors, means that most of the work is to keep people and ideas outside of the boundaries of the field. If they do not, they risk losing control and invite revolutions. Exclusion is thus not meant in a pejorative way; indeed incumbents in professions who find the notion of exclusion distasteful may be surprised to nonetheless discover that their fundamental orientations toward knowledge have exclusionary effects whether they are intended or not.</p>
<p>How then does the password system work as a membrane around scholarly subfields? First, knowledge qua password is arbitrary with respect to content, because club knowledge is not necessarily better quality than other resources made accessible by the archive. Whereas in unarchived fields knowing is enough to gain club membership, archived fields require a substitute exclusion mechanism to safeguard hierarchy. This explains the prominence of priority in the attribution of discovery over the mere fact of possessing knowledge; yet priority defines hierarchy internal to professions and would be overkill in defining the external relations of the profession. Simply, members of a scholarly field need not have invented knowledge to use it to assert their membership status against nonmembers. But the question of knowledge quality, why club knowledge is not substitutable for other available knowledge, is a constant erosive force against the club’s foundation. For the more status insecure in the profession, pride in ignorance of foreign content becomes a weak value to paper over the contradiction, whereas the status secure, who have enjoyed better employment contracts and more time to explore the archive, understand that forbidden fruit are in fact interesting and no real threat to them.</p>
<p>Second, this constant need to build redoubts against deteriorating club walls exists only because scholarship has, in the United States at least, been embedded in educational networks whose value orientation to knowledge opposes that of professions. One modification of professional esotericism is that the passwords are a group secret, which means that anyone who knows they exist can find them out, master them, and gain club membership (if not club rewards). This satisfies the openness required by universalist educational values. To satisfy the closure required by the professions, password mastery must have nontrivial costs. In making the password mandatory clubs construct excludability in an arbitrary set of ideas whose components are not naturally excludable. This encryption cost, like the blockchain, makes the detection of fakes easy while creating trust between incumbents and the newcomers who pledge to honor the prior commitments of the field.</p>
<p>The password is not, however, a shibboleth. A shibboleth is chosen arbitrarily such that the people who are targeted for exclusion are incapable of meeting the criterion. The use of a password that Jews could not pronounce in ancient times, or the job qualification of a high school degree that blacks did not have in more recent times, are both examples of shibboleths used to explicitly target particular groups. The knowledge password system is not so extreme; its function is to both slow the trickle of resources across club boundaries and to compel solicitors to demonstrate a commitment to club values before gaining admission.</p>
<p>Still, the tolerance for exclusionary behavior is relative, and any degree of exclusion may raise the hackles of educators. The password structure perpetually faces destabilizing threats. The entropic force of the archive has already been mentioned, which by itself stresses scholarly boundaries because anyone can acquire expertise independently of professions and then use that to make claims on club goods. <!--Clubs are able to deflect these claims only when the symbolic value of the password is not deflated.--> The other destabilizer is educational values, which mandate that rewards accrue to mastery of process (learning) rather than mastery of products (knowing). Educational values are equitable and universalistic and therefore delegitimize all nonrandom exclusion mechanisms like the password system. But when compromised by professional values education merely requires scholars to reduce the costs of password mastery by forcing investments in pedagogy.</p>
<p>If they were ever able to dominate professions education would force open club boundaries and destroy field cohesion. Defenders of professions would label this a situation of hackery, while detractors would contend that it would still be productive to resource people with idiosyncratic knowledge bases, i.e. those who eschewed the password system. When education and profession are in balance, the password system integrates the conflict between them, forcing some egalitarian openness to replenish the ranks of professions.</p>
<div id="knowledge-as-influence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Knowledge as influence</h3>
<p>This functioning of the password system is not how it is experienced by people. Phenomenologically knowledge templates are not viewed as arbitrary but are rather shrouded in a reputational aura. This aura is manifest as a taste for scholarship. To be professional is to trade in status, to know what are the tasteful combinations of resources. To be a successful professional is to never have wasted time tasting forbidden fruit. It is the laity who bear the brunt of the exclusion mechanism, while clergy who have long ago armed the traps spectate. A lay seeker approaches the academic archive and at great cost of attention plumbs its depths for enlightenment. The archive’s complexity dooms her to check out a curriculum so hopelessly tacky that it will only certify her lay status. In her humiliation she feels a deep injustice that her knowledge is not recognized. A different seeker with guile enough to learn the password first plumbs only the relevant parts of the archive, and upon mastery enters the social compact with incumbent professionals. The two seekers stand next to each other but on either side of a gate. That they are equally educated is clear, but their paths at this point will diverge, one toward the interior of a profession and the other into the wilderness.</p>
<p>In this fable the archivists themselves are tragic figures, stretched as they are between people who profess (declare publicly) and people who educate (lead out). Librarians much prefer to help laity who in their tastelessness welcome guides who will lead them through the grandeur of the archive. The archivists gifted scholars with access to an immortal memory, and looking the horse in the mouth scholars made rules to protect themselves from the responsibilities of using most of it. Paradoxically, in taking the burden of memory off of the shoulders of scholars, thereby freeing them of the pain of legacy suffered by other artists <span class="citation">(Lang and Lang <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Lang1988Recognition" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>)</span>, librarians created a maze of knowledge in which clergy could trap laity.</p>
<p>These rhetorical flourishes are meant to illustrate the socioemotional attitudes that actors in competitive fields have due to the mobilization of knowledge for competitive purposes. The feeling of security in one’s status is itself a social construction. The successful mobilization of knowledge as a resource for intellectual production is not quite the same process as the mobilization of knowledge for career success, though the two are linked. Often it is necessary to win a confidence game against competitors to acquire the resources necessary to do scholarship. The password system is merely one version of this game.</p>
<p>The password system and all other confidence games that deploy knowledge for competitive purposes are members of a theoretical class that <span class="citation">Parsons (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Parsons1963Concept" role="doc-biblioref">1963</a>)</span> called influence. Influence is generalized knowledge-based authority. It is a symbolic medium of communication like money, which represents a value without being the value. Symbols are more easily transacted than the real resources they represent, and they allow trades to be constructed as social commitments before real resources are mobilized. The password list is a symbol of a supplicant’s capacity to uphold genre conventions and safeguard the status of a field, a promise which they aim to transact for access to real resources, namely employment, in a scholarly profession. The mastery of a harder list is like possessing more money; it helps potential sellers rank who they wish to do business with.</p>
<p>Like money, influence is subject to inflation (requiring a candidate to know even more than the password list) and deflation (being unimpressed no matter how much a candidate knows). Importantly influence is not reputation; it is a feature of the status of the field rather than the status of an individual. All knowledge holders transacting with a club will be similarly affected by inflation or deflation of the field’s influence.</p>
<p>There are many more varieties of influence operative in scholarship beside the password system. One of the features of symbolic media is the displacement in time between acquisition and possession. A coffee paid for is socially acquired while one waits for a barista to finish pouring it. In scholarship knowledge tends to be what is transacted, and as with consumer goods, knowledge can be socially acquired prior to its possession. The reputed meaning of texts is an example of acquisition (understanding) without possession (reading). Though above I went to great lengths to argue that the archive is an amazing institutional memory, library technology may paradoxically make it easy to forget scholarship <span class="citation">(Cevolini <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Cevolini2016Forgetting" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. A scholar who is confident that knowledge is safely protected in archives and who believes that it can always be accurately retrieved is relieved of the urgency of digesting it now. Punting on understanding <em>from</em> texts opens space for exogenous understandings <em>of</em> texts.</p>
<p>Contemporaneous cultures and societies constraining the reader prejudge the meanings of texts. While scholars genuflect to a quest for truth, the practical incentive to minimize time spent reading leads to several methods of collusion in the reduction of texts. As has been discussed, any text that can be commonly declared irrelevant need not be bothered with it all. Second, a text need not be read to be understood, as their meanings may have a common sense. Texts have reputations and reputed meanings. These reputations like those of people stand in for the real thing in scholarly discourse. These mediated versions of the truth act as promissory notes in scholarly transactions; where the reputed meaning is accurately conveyed the issuing party is given credit for knowing the underlying truth, without burdening the transaction with a test of the truth, a discussion of a text’s content.</p>
<p>Like all symbolic currencies, the pace of commerce quickens where the symbol of the good is exchanged prior to the good itself needing to be mobilized. A utility of reputed rather than real meanings is to save scholars from the existential crisis besetting them: the pace of the publication of scholarship has long outpaced anyone’s capacity to read it. Reputed meanings allow for the accumulation of a greater body of understanding than would be possible if texts were studied directly. When taken to an extreme this becomes a collective collusion, a stereotype, in which a fairly thin reputation may stand for a particular text without anyone ever demanding to see the goods. The deflation of a reputed meaning is to demand that a person wielding it perform an extra feat to demonstrate that they have command of a text’s contents. Like any status challenge the target will pay the debt of their knowledge or ignorance with a credit or debit to their own reputation.</p>
<p>Taking another step down the collusion path, professions may violate educational norms by trading in reputed meanings rather than direct readings of texts. This is an encryption of their meaning that works exactly as the password. Only members of a subfield may understand the reputed meaning of a text, who in clerical fashion would deign to humiliate a lay person who studied a text outside of the cloister and claimed to know something about it. Parsons would call the factual reading of a text its intrinsic persuasiveness <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Parsons1963Concept" role="doc-biblioref">1963</a>:48)</span>, a value that is put into forbearance when it is symbolically exchanged. If a reputed meaning is elaborated for the sole purpose of esoteric exclusiveness, and the reputation diverges enough from the truth, the colluders may expect to receive status challenges asking to demonstrate the real value of the knowledge. If they fail such tests it will harm their own reputations. Such a scenario is very likely where professional arenas, which demand high volume trading of texts, intersect with educational arenas, which require closer attention to fewer texts. Textbooks, catalogs of knowledge products without their attendant knowledge factors, contain nothing but reputed meaning, and therefore represent a good example of a professional rather than an educational approach to teaching.</p>
