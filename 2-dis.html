<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Social science is arranged into disciplines in a manner similar to the genre systems of commercial fields of cultural production (FCP) like music, yet evolving at a slower pace. Genres appear static and given in the form of the labeling schemes of archivists and librarians. Such schemes aim to describe academic genres objectively, yet in so doing referencers and indexers reify them historically. Such genre classifications are at times useful, frustrating, or didactic for the academic “disciples” or knowledge workers of higher education. This study maps the cognitive system of genre classifications in one particular labeling scheme, that of the JSTOR historical archive, as applied to one aspect of academic FCPs, journals. The patterns of interdisciplinary cross labeling, of allowing journals to bear multiple labels, are represented as a network and then visualized to reveal how global axes among science, social science, and humanities condition the local relationships of disciplines like sociology and anthropology.</p>

<hr />
<p>The classification of cultural products according to genre systems has been treated both as a top-down institutional process conditioning the development of entire markets <span class="citation">(Brook <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Brook1994Symphonie" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>; Lena and Peterson <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Lena2008Classification" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> and as “nothing but” an emergent, bottom-up process of individual acts of labeling and interpretive judgement <span class="citation">(Hitters and Kamp <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Hitters2010Tune" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; Lamont <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Lamont2010How" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. A middle range approach requires understanding how actors distributed across the roles that constitute structure, the top down perspective, make local judgements that either do or do not have global consequences. The idea of genre as a cognitive institution that is diffused across a wide variety of actors gives the appearance of a cultural integrator, something given in the environment of all actors and not controlled by any of them. Players on fields of cultural production regardless of their role or status are, like price takers in a market, cultural name takers. Once genre labels are established they are immutable and given as terms in the language. The content to which they refer, however, is historically variable and debatable.</p>
<p>The explanation of how genre labels and the content to which they refer develops over time requires a mapping of the structure of genre labels at particular moments. In this study I estimate a mapping of the cognitive associations among genre categories of scholarship according to one interested role position in the scholarly field of cultural production, the archivist. Archives play a constitutional role for scholarly fields, forming a necessary infrastructure for scholars’ work, but scholars are not the only interests served by archives. Students and educators as well as the public also draw on knowledge resources contained in the archive. To make this knowledge accessible archivists use genre classifications to organize content. The classifications meet the practical needs of serving both the producers and consumers of the content. The granularity of the classification system that would be useful to producers is, however, much finer than what is useful for consumers (note that the same item may either be factor of production or a product). The bias of the archive skews toward the courser grained consumer classification system in part because the needs of producers are highly idiosyncratic, shifting, and difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Producers tend to dismiss the consumers’ ways of thinking about their field, but there is one situation in which producers are reduced to consumers; in scholarly professions the coarse version of classification is a communicative infrastructure for foreign correspondence. These coarse categories are what we call disciplines. Disciplines are nothing but a genre like classification system; they are merely integrative of global transactions among scholars at a distance and between scholarship as a whole and its macroscopic interlocutors, namely education, grant making, and university administration. Thus when scholars view content situated outside of their local epicenters of research, they necessarily shift from fine to coarse grained judgements. This switch on the tracks may be jolting, as it connotes what they feel to be a demotion of their usual status.</p>

<p>Facing inwardly, producers deploy value standards rather than classifications. In their own field, scholars grant themselves moral and aesthetic authority to judge the quality of content. In communicating outside of their field, where they have no jurisdiction, assessment of cultural items becomes value neutral, a mere matter of taste. Such internal values may even be simple dualisms compared to the more complicated disciplinary categories, but rather than creating simple genre-like schemes they create scales of gradient evaluation. <span class="citation">Abbott (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Abbott2001Chaos" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> shows that these scales, for instance from idiographic to nomathetic, are established by the accumulation of simple judgments by separate individuals in the direct and often pairwise comparisons of discrete works or authors. This pattern of evaluation is chaotic and produces a fractal organization of content with only approximate correspondence among judges. Though Abbott <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Abbott2001Chaos" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>:14)</span> suggests that these fractals are irreducible to simple one or two-dimensional scales, it is likely that the chaotic outcomes are collapsed into a reified commensuration standard when facilities and rewards are distributed <span class="citation">(Espeland and Stevens <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Espeland1998Commensuration" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Disciplines are much more like genres than the constellation of fields and subfields that scholars may be accustomed to thinking with in the course of their work. Genres function to the extent that they are globally recognizable, that is, ubiquitous. Ubiquity means that all members of a field regardless of status are able to learn enough about the genre to make accurate classifications of cultural objects. This does not mean that everyone will always necessarily be aware of all genre labels, or that their classifications will always be accurate, but it does mean that they will be able to learn the rules when it becomes necessary. Subfield categories are not ubiquitous in this way; subfield labels only become genre-like by restricting the reference group to a more esoteric level. Whereas all members of a university, for instance, may easily become aware of the discipline of sociology, written as it may be on a building, only disciples of sociology are likely to become aware of the subfield of conversation analysis. And while disciples may learn the label, it takes some real experience with the content of the discipline, if not necessarily the subfield, to understand that conversation analysis is more qualitative than population research and more quantitative than ethnography.</p>
<p>In this way the classification schemes are nested in a functional hierarchy that shifts according to which role relationships are activated in the field. The more fine grained distinctions among genres are derivable from the collapsed fractal patterns. The highest level of granularity one is able to discuss may be a status signal of where they belong within a disciplinary stratification system. Furthermore the interactional capacities of disciples are nested. Denizens of more interior spaces in a subdiscipline, the spaces of fractal evaluation, are always able to operate successfully in more granular interactions, but the reverse is not true.</p>

<p>Everyone starts at the more ubiquitous level. It is only through education or professional socialization that newcomers can learn genre classifications, and most members of the public will not even be aware of the disciplinary categories of academic knowledge. The genre system sits in a more optimized relationship between descriptiveness and stability. The disciplines only change a glacial pace, while the genres are stable enough to maintain relevance for entire generations of scholars. The fractal patterns are so granular that they may not even survive in the memory of a particular person over the years. In its constant interaction with the chaos of actual knowledge production, the genre system provides a more stable medium that is open to change but not so open as to risk dissolution. Scholars may complain that their work is not adequately represented by the genre system, and if enough make the same argument, the genre system may update to allow a wider audience to recognize the novel work. This is not to say that the work need actually be novel. As Abbott observes, each generation of scholars tends to cycle through forgetting and then reinventing the knowledge it had just cast aside <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Abbott2001Chaos" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>:24)</span>.</p>
<p>The level of disciplines reformats the interaction of fractal evaluation and genre codification, just at a higher resolution that is oriented to the external relationships of the university. Where knowledges are separated by great cultural if not necessarily semantic distances, such as for instance the divide between biology and sociology, scholars in distant disciplines may not have much better knowledge about each other than a random member of the public. Disciplines emerge at a societal scale in a way that lets the university enter exchange relationships with government and the economy.</p>
<p>This definition of discipline is isomorphic with that of genre, in that disciplines are another form of categorical decision making, just at a higher level. Disciplines are supergenres that reflect the nesting of categories. In music Lena and Petersen <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Lena2008Classification" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>:698)</span> have followed Ennis <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Ennis1992seventh" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> in referring to supergenres like rock-n-roll or rhythm and blues “streams”, which are genres linked in time by any of a number of contiguities, e.g. sound, scene, artist, or market. What may distinguish disciplines in a more serious way is the institutional underpinning of the category. If genres are formed by the categorical thinking of disciples, disciplines are formed by the categorical thinking of patrons, the powerful actors like university administrators, state legislators, and grant makers who manage the economic foundation of scholarly careers, as well as the elite disciples who interface with these stakeholders. Where genre labels are inscribed onto cultural products, texts, discipline labels are inscribed onto cultural infrastructure like funding lines, buildings, and personnel themselves.</p>
<p>The uses of genre labels are themselves systematically organized by discipline, and a disciple who is adequately trained will know the correct ways to use genre labels in her local context. To use genre as a disciplinary convention means to first identify your location in the disciplinary field, and then to accept the limitations on scope by excluding knowledges and relationships that are extradisciplinary, that is, irrelevant. Disciplinary structure reduces the true cultural complexity of the entire genre system to a restricted form of local relevance, which in turn allows humble knowledge workers to engage upon a set of shared assumptions. Such simplicity begets new complexity as disciples spin out the consequences of their local use of genre.</p>
<p>The genres are also economic principles helping to organize supply and demand within internal scholarly markets for cultural products. There actors see genres among the borders between economic, social, and cultural uses, as a market category helping them acquire or produce content, as a card in proximate games of prestige, or as something to taste, to consume and enjoy directly. Publishers and journal editors leverage genres to help producers and consumers find them, as proclaiming a venue’s genre identity is the cheapest way to advertise. Still, journals must also contend with the fractal evaluation of producers, and this may lead to creative positioning within the genre system if not usually the disciplinary system. As a way to signal that they are not merely generic, which is to say boring, a journal may position itself between rather than squarely within genres. This kind of recombinant innovation maintains the stability of both the genre and the discipline systems while at the same time opening up space for the fractal distinctions to work themselves out in creative ways <span class="citation">(Gitlin <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Gitlin2000Triumph" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>; Vedres and Stark <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Vedres2010Structural" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>What I seek to accomplish in the remainder of this study is to understand how the global disciplinary structure is reflected in the indexing behavior of archivists as they attempt to locate journals within a given classification scheme. Archivists have an important role is distributing the classification system and regulating it across a large population of knowledge seekers. While they do not author the discipline categories they do provide the an infrastructure that facilitates their taken-for-grantedness. In attempting to understand how a particular item of cultural content fits into a classification system, their only degree of freedom is to apply multiple labels to the item. This turns a binary distinction, is this item discipline-relevant or not, into something more nuanced, this item is partly relevant and partly not.</p>
<p>I use the JSTOR archive as a case of the work of archivists to index cultural material in a way that is useful to consumers. This requires making classification decisions about underlying items. In this case they make decisions about which discipline, which they call subjects, particular journals belong to. And to make every journal fit, they may apply multiple labels in an attempt to cover the content of the journal in a parsimonious way. By observing how the patterns of multiple classification are organized we can see how the disciplinary classification system is adapted to meet the requirements of more granular levels. Rather than marking boundaries of strict relevance, what we will find are regions of proximity within which partial relevance is established. This allows scholars to be innovative without losing their grounding in the discipline system. And for journals who have an interest in stable reproduction of scholarly activity, it allows publishers and editors to position themselves as having jurisdiction over particular kinds of innovation.</p>
