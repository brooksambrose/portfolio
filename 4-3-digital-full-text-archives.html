<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Digital full-text archives</h2>
<p>In order to develop time series from a census of words, we rely on computational text analysis (CTA) or “distant reading” as it it known in the humanities. It will be helpful to consider the epistemological opportunities and challenges presented by the distant reading approach. While controversial in humanistic circles that emphasize the primacy of the reader’s novel interpretive work when consuming text, distant reading fits comfortably within a social science epistemology that aims to achieve an objective description of intellectual history. Indeed, computational methods offer a useful backstop to the subjectivity of a particular person’s reading of history. Topic modeling, one method of CTA, promises to automate a particular slice of what hermeneutic methods accomplish. Hermeneutics claims that through historical methods it is possible to reconstruct the interpretive context of texts such that they can be understood in the same way that contemporary historical actors understood them. Establishing such context is a laudable yet arduous feat of historical research to uncover the social and intellectual milieu of a particular text. This is the gold standard approach, but one that restricts the field to specialists with the training and resources necessary for the undertaking.</p>
<p>Computers cannot study history in this way. What they can do, however, is mine source material for limited kinds of contexts. The kind we are concerned with below are the historical vocabularies that writers used to construct texts in the past. Vocabularies are glyphs without grammar; they do not mean anything, but nothing meaningful can be said without them in the present or in the past. They are the mediated form of language, and in communicating with each other historical actors leave traces that survive perfectly in time so long as texts themselves survive.</p>
<p>While computers cannot read meaning in texts, and can barely recognize it, they are almost as good as humans at recognizing the glyphs of texts, and vocabularies are nothing but glyphs. What computers lack in smarts, they make up in speed and memory. The quantitative scale of their recognition makes for a qualitative shift because vocabularies can be enumerated across immense corpora of texts. Immense, at least, by human standards as there are limits to even computer memory and speed. Yet such enumeration of texts into objective historical categories is a profound resource for the intellectual historian. That one could begin a reading with such context would be a transformative research tool. Vocabulary enumeration, by which we mean simply the counting and classifying of texts according to the vocabularies they contain, invites a population studies approach to intellectual history. Where sense-making is driven by comparisons, a reader’s arbitrary combination of texts is guaranteed to lead to anachronism. But if we can know that texts are relevant to each other without knowing why, we have done some small amount of hermeneutic work by supplying texts as historically correct context to each other.</p>
<p>And even going so far as abandoning the project of reading texts in a historically correct way, vocabulary enumeration can still lend objectivity to a novel construction, a productive anachronism, of textual meaning. Because vocabularies, the problems solved by computers, are mathematically, algorithmically, or stochastically determined, they may provide an immutable description of corpora that, like a map, enables individual and collective exploration within a common framework. Such maps may become the parameters of interpretive methods, which we may use to surface and control some of our subjectivity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Quality of evidence</h3>
<p>Computational text analysis requires that text corpora be transformed from a human to a machine readable format. Several efforts to digitize paper archives have made historical research designs possible, notably the Google Books project, HathiTrust, and the ITHAKA JSTOR archive. Digital storage devices like the portable document format (PDF) have also enabled texts to be represented in both a digital version and as a reasonable facsimile of paper originals. Reasonable, we should say, for most sociological purposes, but not for other historical questions where materiality of culture is important <span class="citation">(Schreibman <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Schreibman2014NonConsumptive" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>:149)</span>.</p>
<p>Digital archives make research into the production of culture difficult, precisely because they misrepresent several aspects of the means of production. Researchers should be mindful that digitization of texts abstracts some qualities of texts and renders many others invisible. The importance of physical space and material qualities of libraries is illegible when working with digital archives, while the verbal content of texts is highlighted. We must keep in mind that we are not viewing what historical actors saw. Digital texts are almost perfectly fungible, while, variability in the format and material condition of historical texts may have been common. We are liable, for instance, to underestimate the search costs to locate texts, and the fungibility of texts themselves.</p>
<p>Simply put, if the texts we analyze are not the ones that historical actors read, can we be said to really be doing something historical? There are reasons to believe that digital text archives provide not just a useful but an historically valid abstraction from the material texts. If we want to understand how an individual scholar understood a particular text, better to have her personal copy, margin notes and all. Yet how would that scholar have treated the text as a cultural item? She would abstract her own copy to a format credibly held in common, the more antiseptically clean version that we see in digital archives. These are the ghosts of the texts, so to speak, but they are what would be left when all idiosyncrasies were removed, the version that one would assume colleagues thought of when declaring that text publicly.</p>
<!-- This comment on evidentiary foundations introduces the theme of this paper, which is the difference between personal and social meanings of texts, and more generally how tendencies toward idiosyncracy attenuate those toward conformity, and vice versa. -->
<p>This is by way of saying that the texts we compile below are not the same that were read by the historical actors under consideration. They are the texts that historical actors would assume their contemporaries were reading, that is, the sanitized, fungible, original published form of the text. By getting at these texts, we are getting at the real historical infrastructure for scholarly communication.</p>

<div id="data-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Data</h3>
<p>The optical character recognition that computers require in order to store text digitally depends critically on the hard work of creating quality scans of journal archives. JSTOR has done a commendable job of this. The entire record for two journals, American Anthropologist and the American Journal of Sociology, was downloaded manually in PDF format, including front and back matter, articles, and book reviews.<a href="bibliography.html#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Though JSTOR offers an automated service for downloading texts in the bag-of-words format, a frequency table of the terms within it, we opted to use the PDF version which preserves word order. This full text format may be converted into a bag-of-words, but it will also give us the option to choose a unit of analysis smaller than the document by letting us divide the texts at points of our choosing.</p>
<!--## Sampling {#kd-dp1}-->
<p>Table <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#tab:filt">4.3</a> summarizes the data preparation process. The sample included 5,444 documents containing on average nine pages and 43 paragraphs each. Upon initial importing of PDFs it was apparent that some of the digitization given by JSTOR was partial or corrupted. This was detectable as PDF documents with many pages but few characters. Such texts were re-digitized prior to analysis, and failure to do so would have left considerable data gaps that would have influenced the results.</p>
<p>The cleaning of these raw units is a nontrivial task, first because there are many more items of text in a document than are actually relevant body text, and second because some body text was for one reason or another not successfully digitized during optical character recognition. Rather than writing ad hoc rules to filter out particular lines of text, we take a supervised machine learning approach. We drew a random sample of 1,250 “paragraphs”, which included both real syntactic paragraphs and any other elements delineated by a return, from the original PDF import, and we removed 250 for a holdout set for later model testing. We then hand coded all 1,250 training and test paragraphs according to a simple binary of “keep” or “drop”. Examples of dropped paragraphs include anything from bibliography entries or partial text from numerical tables to optical character recognition (OCR) false positives, like stray marks on a page or character recognition of a photograph. Items to keep reflected any substantial body text even if it contained some OCR errors.</p>
<p>Given the training set, we measured a dozen features to describe the contents of the paragraph. For instance, the number of vowels, consonants, numbers, and special characters were recorded. These features, both as raw counts and as proportions of the total number of characters per paragraph, were merged with the hand coded labels. The training portion was then fed to a super learner <span class="citation">(Polley et al. <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Polley2019SuperLearner" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, which is an ensemble of several different kinds of linear and nonlinear prediction models. <span class="citation">Laan, Polley, and Hubbard (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-vanderLaan2007Super" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> have shown that a linear combination of the predictions of a diverse set of underlying learning models yields results that are more accurate than any model alone. Once the model was trained, it was validated on the 250 paragraphs in the test set. The model yields a probability that a particular paragraph should be dropped, and a probability threshold must be chosen to decide whether unlabeled paragraphs should be given the keep or drop label. We use a common measure of learner quality called area under the curve (AUC), which measures the performance of a learner as a ratio of the true positive to false positive rate across all classification thresholds. AUC has a possible range of 0.5 (perfect misclassification) to 1 (perfect classification). The model scored a value of 0.9871.</p>
<p>The high AUC of our cleaning model gives us confidence that we will have a favorable rate of misclassification even when applying a very lax threshold value. We chose a low probability score of 0.32 as the threshold, which favors more false positives (keeping a drop) and fewer false negatives (dropping a keep). This permissive threshold is warranted because some of the false positives, which may be mixtures of good and bad text, are likely to be filtered out during subsequent data preparation steps. Roughly one third of paragraphs were dropped by this procedure, which is also an indication of how important this step is to get right. Indeed we may have more confidence in our ability to clean given access to the original full text than being supplied a bag-of-words format which offers little context for deciding what to filter out.</p>
<p>Once data are clean they may be tokenized, which is to split at word and punctuation boundaries. We invented a reversible bag-of-words (BOW) data format to store tokenization such that the document, page, line, and paragraph locations of each token are preserved. Conventionally this information is thrown out, but keeping it allows great flexibility to the analyst and also makes it possible to trace even a BOW style technique like topic modeling back to the originating text. It also allows the researcher to easily bin tokens differently than at the document level, providing an opportunity for multilevel analysis. To wit, by revealing punctuation, the reversible BOW format lets us count sentences as well.</p>
<p>The final step is called pre-processing, and involves making decisions about which tokens to keep and which to discard. In the reversible BOW format nothing is actually dropped, rather tokens are flagged by different drop criterion. For instance true/false value of whether a token is a stop-word or a number is recorded. The researcher may then query the database differently for different research decisions. We dropped punctuation, stop-words, terms smaller than three characters, and we kept numbers especially out of a concern to preserve dates. Finally all tokens are lemmatized, which reduced words in several parts of speech to a root. For instance, the lemma for “run”, “ran”, and “running” may simply be “run”. Lemma are often abstract or non words themselves, so to aid in later interpretation we calculated the lemma common term, which is the token of highest frequency within a lemma category.</p>

<p>With some data in hand we may now describe anthropology and sociology in terms of the content of their two leading journals, American Anthropologist (AA) and the American Journal of Sociology (AJS). Figure <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#fig:jdpf-desc">4.10</a> plots the total number of items contained in the journal each year, including, in addition to research articles, front and back matter, book reviews, advertisements, errata, and other miscellaneous items. First it can be noticed that AA has almost a decade’s lead before the start of AJS, but that AJS starts as a larger publication in these terms. It is sensible to expect that because anthropology was an empirical discipline that the rate of completion of research projects, which often required substantial field work, would be less than sociology, which had a greater role for social theory which was simply easier to produce. The trend for AA rose steadily but approached a plateau by 1910, after which it declined rapidly until the start of WWI. Two scenarios suggest themselves, first that these were delays in publishing received material as there was a steep correction in 1915, or second that this was an actual shift in focus precipitated by unsettled lives at the dawn of war. Sociology did not appear to experience a decline at all, but rather an acceleration of activity perhaps in anticipation of the war and continuing after.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#fig:pre2ntok">4.11</a> paints a more granular picture and shows a sharper contrast between the two journals. Here we see the count of the total number of words appearing in the journal each year, which allows us to control for variation in the physical format of the volumes. In the decade before the turn of the century AA plodded along very steadily in the neighborhood of 125,000 words a year. Perhaps noticing that it was being eclipsed in scale by peers in the social sciences, or perhaps because of the pressure of the newly arriving Ph.D.s, AA nearly doubles its output in a single year. It could not however sustain the injection and steadily falls back to its original level in a trend that all but ignores the war, save for a flurry of activity in 1915. These trends suggest that anthropology struggled to maintain its footing at it adapted to the new university context and the growth of its peers.</p>

</div>
<p>We may now drill down further into these words. The goal of the following analysis will be to organize the text within each journal into subcategories of common vocabulary. We hesitate to call these subfields without qualitative cross validation, which is beyond the scope of the present study. What we will be able to accomplish is a prima facie argument for the scale and diversity of vocabularies at play within each journal. As we have discussed, vocabularies are not ideas, but they are good indications of who is speaking and about what.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-many-topics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> How many topics?</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for a study of historical vocabularies is discerning the scale of diversity. To borrow from Wuthnow <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Wuthnow1989Communities" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> and at the risk of impoverishing the term, how many different communities of discourse were at play within the journal space and in the relatively settled time following the sowing period? In this section we leverage the rich text data at our disposal to take a data modeling approach to answering this question. Doing so will require passing a technical hurdle in the application of the particular method of topic modeling that we have discussed.</p>
<p>In using topic models to address historical questions researchers have found it very useful to assume an arbitrary number of topics, because the results of the model may still provide insights even when the true diversity of vocabularies is unknown. Some lines of research consider the gold standard for whether the analyst has chosen the right number to be the ease with which human readers can interpret topics <span class="citation">(Chang et al. <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Chang2009Reading" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. In our case our goal is to capture a real phenomenon that is independent of our likely anachronistic readings of texts. We want to know the number of vocabularies that were actually at play in the historical situation, the expectation being that the number is far greater than an analyst might choose for either interpretive or computational convenience.</p>
<p>Researchers conventionally feed entire documents into the construction of term frequencies. This method treats any term in a document as being related to any other term by the same degree. The goal of any topic mixture model algorithm is to sift these terms into different topic categories by looking for clues across documents; a topic can be “seen” in a particular document to the extent that other documents include that topic as well as other topics not present in the focal article, such that the intersection of terms reveals the topic. But a much simpler assumption to reduce the attendant noise within a document is to merely feed lower level syntactic structures–paragraphs and sentences–to the algorithm. We will see that doing so greatly improves the usefulness of discovered topics.</p>
<p>To infer the correct number of topics we use the method described by <span class="citation">Mimno and Lee (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Mimno2014Lowdimensional" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> and implemented in the R package <code>stm</code> <span class="citation">(Roberts et al. <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Roberts2018stm" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. The concept is to represent words as coordinates in a vector space defined by every other term in the corpus, operationally as a square matrix with height and width equal to the length of the number of unique words in the global corpus, which in this case is 6,668. The elements of this matrix, called <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, are counts of the number of texts in which both words appear. Leveraging the anchor words technique of <span class="citation">Arora et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Arora2018Learning" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, which posits that for every topic there exists a term present for that topic and no others, it is possible to identify these anchor words as points on a convex hull encompassing every other term in the corpus. The calculation of the convex hull of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is nontrivial in its original high dimensional space but can be approximated. Mimno and Lee argue rather than approximate the convex hull in high dimensions the hull may be calculated exactly in an approximation of the original space in a low number of dimensions.</p>
<p>The value of this approach is that the exact calculation of the convex hull of an approximation of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> solves two important problems for the resolution of a topic model; it makes an inference about the number of topics <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and identifies the anchor words that can be used to exactly calculate the topic by term matrix. Mimno and Lee recommend a combination of computationally fast algorithms–random principal component analysis <span class="citation">(rPCA, Rokhlin, Szlam, and Tygert <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Rokhlin2009Randomized" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings <span class="citation">(t-SNE, Maaten and Hinton <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Maaten2008Visualizing" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>–to achieve the low dimensional approximation of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>Though this is a clever solution to the choice of the number and contents of topics, in practice there is a lot of measurement error due to the randomization aspects of the <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> approximation. Looking at just the estimate of the number of topics, repeating the algorithm multiple times creates a count distribution of possible Ks. On our corpus the median count of the number of topics running the approximation 1,000 times was 78, with a 95 percent confidence interval between 60 and 100. While this is very helpful in getting the researcher into the ballpark for choosing the correct <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, models fit with these varying assumptions for the number of topics will yield very different results.</p>
<p>While it may be sensible to simply choose the median outcome of 78 for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, it is not obvious that a notion of central tendency is appropriate given the highly nonlinear structure of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. To get a sense of how the empirical distribution of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> compares to a plausible parametric distribution we model the error in the inference of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> as a Poisson, using a maximum likelihood estimate of 78.894 for lambda. We then simulate from this distribution to obtain a range for each <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. By and large the observed counts of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> fall within the ranges for each possible <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> suggested by this distribution very well, which lends credence to choice of lambda as the correct <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are however a few notable exceptions at the extremes of the distribution that diverge considerably from the Poisson. On the low side, a <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of 50 occurs much more often, appearing more than six standard deviations higher than the expectation. On the high side a <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of 104 appears more than four standard deviations more often.</p>
<p>It may be that the task of coming up with the one true number of topics is not itself valid, that instead there may be several valid choices for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> that differ by an assumption about the resolution of the underlying topic structure of the documents. It may not be a coincidence that the mean of 50 and 104, 77, is almost exactly the same as the median value 78 of repeated runs of the low dimensional embedding method of Mimno and Lee. If we assume for the sake of argument that these three levels of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> are each valid, it implies that there may be a topic resolution assumption that helps explain the estimation variability.</p>
<p>We theorize that the three <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> tiers discovered here reflect a real pattern of topic classifications. We posit that the low level of 50 describes the true seed topics out of which further combinations are routinely developed. The mid level of 78 we posit as a nonrandom pattern of combinations of the original 50 that is much lower than the thousands of combinatoric possibilities given 50 seed topics. Finally the high level of 104 we predict represents a transition from common to idiosyncratic discourses, the point at which the topic model begins to identify features of language and style that are sometimes considered junk but that are more appropriately conceptualized as personal rather than public features of discourse.</p>
<p>To explore the conjecture that the low tier represents elemental topics, we conducted the following test. Documents are expected to be mixtures of topics, but we may surmise that these mixtures are a result of combining many lower level syntactic units that are themselves unmixed or at least less mixed, that is, that only express one or two topics. Sentences and paragraphs are easily identifiable low level syntactic units given access to the original full text of documents. It is credible to expect sentences or paragraphs to yield a clarified topic structure. Splitting up documents introduces an assumption that proximity matters even if word order is not strictly preserved. The bag-of-words format leads to the same association between words no matter how far apart they actually appear in the original text, though we may believe that words on the same page are more relevant to each other than words several pages apart. Organizing the large bag, documents, into smaller bags effectively prunes the associations of terms that are far apart by completely ignoring them unless they are very close together.</p>
<p>Figures <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#fig:sim-fig">4.12</a> and <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#fig:sim-fig2">4.13</a> illustrate the results of repeating the procedure of Mimno and Lee at these different syntactic levels. In Figure <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#fig:sim-fig">4.12</a> the density of observed counts are represented as points labeled with their corresponding <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> value. The curves represent the fitted Poisson distributions for each level, while the shaded areas represent the simulated confidence intervals for each possible value of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. As mentioned, most labels fall within the confidence interval, which suggests the the medians are a good operationalization of the real <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. This however appears to be more true of the document than the sentence or paragraph levels, which seem to be systematically above the curve in the center of the distribution and below it on the tails.</p>

</div>
<p>This feature of a more pointed shape is called leptokurtosis and corresponds to a kurtosis score greater than zero. If the empirical distributions of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> are more leptokurtotic than the assumed Poisson error distribution it would suggest there is a tendency for the random search to be pulled more strongly to the median of these distributions, in a sense “pointing to” the true <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> value, lending weight to the median as the correct value of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. To test whether this appearance is significant we calculate the kurtosis of all simulated distributions from each Poisson and then calculate the probability that the observed kurtosis is less than the simulation. The results are reported in Table <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#tab:mlk2k">4.4</a>. First, the appearance of leptokurtotic “pointedness” is not supported by a calculation of each distribution’s actual kurtosis in the case of documents or of paragraphs, and only very weakly in the case of sentences. None of the observed distributions are significantly more leptokurtotic than their associated Poisson, though it is more probable that the sentence level is more pointed than the other two.</p>

<p>Though the kurtosis test amounts to only very weak evidence that sentences represent a more stable topic structure than paragraphs or documents, when viewing the outcomes at the three levels together a more confident conclusion is apparent. Figure <a href="4-3-digital-full-text-archives.html#fig:sim-fig2">4.13</a> plots only the labels that are significantly different than their Poisson errors. What is notable about the highly significant <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of 50 at the document level is that it is located at the center of the combined sentence and paragraph structure. This suggests that 50 is a very good choice for the documents but one that a random search is very unlikely to find. That there is correspondence between the solution at different syntactic structures makes sense since documents are nothing but their sentences and paragraphs. By using the comparison to lower level units we conclude that 50 is the best choice for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> for a document level topic model.</p>
