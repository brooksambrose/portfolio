<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> History of Ideas</h1>
<p>Though the intellectual history of the social sciences begins well before the Civil War, the current epoch of its institutional history, the epoch of professions, becomes possible only in the postbellum period. Before the Civil War, social research was a skilled occupation, and individual researchers found patrons through government and civil institutions supporting pursuits of knowledge, such as the American Philosophical Society (APS) founded in 1743 in Philadelphia. One of the great consequences of war was renewed federal investment in nation building in its aftermath. Some Union congressmen saw the rebellion as a failure of education, prompting the creation of the U.S. Department of Education in 1867 to strengthen nation building. In the postbellum period both anthropology and sociology develop as professions due primarily to the growth of universities as a new context of their activity. Without universities, social research would have remained an occupation in need of clientele. With them, social research develops the resources enabling relative autonomy, self reproduction, and occupational closure, the hallmarks of a profession. This study seeks to examine the period of transition after the Civil War from social research as occupation to social research as profession.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Antebellum Social Research 1783-1865</h2>
<p>U.S. nation building had continued since the end of the American Revolution and had enrolled researchers in the projects of westward expansion against native peoples, the consolidation of slave economies against Africans, and the legitimation of the American experiment against European detractors. These were pressing problems to the intellectuals among government leaders at different levels, and they worked to make investments in new knowledge to resolve them. Such new knowledge was initially an extension of older “theories of man” in theology and enlightenment natural philosophy, which had a foothold in the private education of the American so-called natural aristocracy as well as in urban colonial institutions like the APS serving as meeting places for intellectual elites and scholars. After the British burned the Library of Congress in 1914 Thomas Jefferson famously sold his personal library to Congress to restore it, an illustration that secular arts and sciences were produced and maintained by and under the patronage of private elites.</p>
<p>The “theory of man” in the colonial period was that historical progress played out along a scale from savagery to barbarism to civilization, and that movement in the direction of progress was a function of time and innate capacity. European societies of the Old World had the best endowment of each, for they were very old (seen as continuous with pre-Christian antiquity) and were lead by aristocracies and monarchies representing the highest human capacities. Conversely colonized peoples, and colonial societies themselves, were understood to suffer low endowments of both, developing slowly due to their lack of morality, reason, and aesthetics and having had less time to achieve what little progress they could.</p>
<p>To gain parity with their colonial masters, the American elite altered the theory to emphasize capacity over time. Because all men were equal, the Americas could achieve greatness meeting or surpassing Europe given independence and opportunity. Their masters scoffed at the idea that a colony could ever “catch up” to the development of Europe, with aristocratic families charting their roots into antiquity. American elites, especially Southerners like Jefferson, saw themselves as naturally superior to their countrymen, taking an aristocratic role in their own country, but not requiring the ancient lineages qualifying aristocracy in Europe. The values of the Declaration were egalitarian only in this limited sense of parity across civilizations.</p>
<p>Egalitarianism did not mean parity within civilizations. Colonial theologians, philosophers, and learned elites had long provided the intellectual rationalizations of the domination of women and the environment, and such reasoning was readily exported to the yet unresolved problems of native tribes and African slaves. Paradoxically egalitarian values reinforced rather than ameliorated supremacist ideologies at home. If all men were equal, and natives (or Africans, or women) were clearly inferior, then natives must not be men. The racism of the Old World order in which hierarchy and domination were natural and unproblematic, was also a consequence of egalitarian values but for different reasons. Such racism was indeed more pernicious in America as the concept of equality invited even more ardent “proof” of the inferiority of dominated peoples.</p>
<p>American intellectuals knew the same logic of inferiority could be applied to the American elite who if they could not match the rate of progress of European society would be judged a newly diverging and potentially inferior race of men. Though it did little to ameliorate white male supremacist thinking, the contradictions between the universalistic and egalitarian values expressed in the U.S. Constitution did occasionally create grist for academic debate leading to some investments in research critical of extant racist typologies. In Europe scholars of comparative languages charted the supposed common origins of European cultures and the time it had taken them to diverge. This inspired Jefferson to patronize ethnological research on the languages of native tribes in America. He had by 1785 amassed enough data to appreciate their diversity, which he took as evidence that New World cultures may be older, and therefore more developed, than commonly assumed by colonizers.</p>
<p>The egalitarian-for-its-time thinking of Jefferson did not contravene racism, but it did provide a different model of racial hierarchy, which could be consequential for government projects. Jefferson thought that if all men are equal, that they share the same human capacity for progress, then native people had merely not had the time to develop and discover progress for themselves. They could and should be taught, especially to abandon hunting in favor of agriculture. For a brief time in the 1840s the Virginia legislature used tax incentives and educational programs to promote intermarriage between male settlers and native women with the goal of accelerating the natural development of native culture. <span class="citation">(Patterson <a href="#ref-Patterson2001Social">2001</a>:9)</span> Such experiments were short lived, as the predictable backlash was that such mixing would risk lowering white culture rather than elevating Indian, and genocidal and segregationist policies won out. Thus while all racial models concluded with the domination of natives by settlers, different models of racial hierarchy sewed policy disputes within colonial leadership.</p>
<p>The role of social research then was to be in service of either government or private political associations. Careers were made for anthropologists in patronage relationships to generate knowledge to aid nation builders.</p>
